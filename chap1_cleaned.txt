CHAPTER 1  THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
You know that expression, “Slow and steady wins the race”?Ever heard the story of the tortoise and the hare? Ladies andgentlemen, I’m the tortoise. Give me enough time, and I willbeat virtually anybody, anytime, in any competition. Why?Not because I’m the best or the smartest or the fastest. I’ll winbecause of the positive habits I’ve developed, and because ofthe consistency I use in applying those habits. I’m the world’sbiggest believer in consistency. I’m living proof that it’s theultimate key to success, yet it’s one of the biggest pitfallsfor people struggling to achieve. Most people don’t knowhow to sustain it. I do. I have my father to thank for that. Inrst coach for igniting the power of theCompound Effect.My parents divorced when I was eighteen months old, andmy dad raised me as a single father. He wasn’t exactly the soft,he hard-wired me for achievement. 
Thanks to Dad, wake-up calls were at six o’clock everymorning. Not by a loving tap on the shoulder or even thesound of a radio alarm. No, I was awakened each morningby the repetitious pile-driving sound of iron pounding on theconcr oor of our garage, situated next to my bedroom.It was like waking up twelve feet from a construction zone.He’d painted a huge “No pain, no gain” sign on the wall of thegarage, which he stared at while he did countless old-schoolstrongman dead lifts, power cleans, lunges, and squats. Rain,sleet, or shine, Dad was out there in his shorts and tatteredsweatshirt. He never missed a day. You could set your watchby his routine.I had more chores than a housekeeper and gardener puttogether. Upon returning from school, there was always a listof instructions to greet me: pull weeds, rake leaves, sweep thegarage, dust, vacuum, do the dishes—you name it. And gettingbehind in school wasn’t tolerated. That’s just the way it was.Dad was the original “no excuses” guy. We weren’t everallowed to stay home from school sick, unless we were actuallypuking, bleeding, or “showing bone.” The term “showing bone”came from his coaching days; his players knew they weren’tallowed to come out of the game unless they were seriouslyinjured. One time his quarterback asked to be pulled out ofthe game. Dad said, “Not unless you’re showing bone.” Thequarterback pulled back his shoulder pads, and sure enough,his collarbone was showing. Only then was he allowed to comeof eld.One of Dad’s core philosophies was, “It doesn’t matter how 
smart you are or aren’t, you need to make up in hard work whatyou lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability. If yourcompetitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you justneed to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!”No matter what the challenge, he taught me to make up in hardwork for wherever I might be disadvantaged. Miss free throws atthe game? Do one thousand free throws every day for a month.Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right handbehind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in yourmath? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summeruntil you get it. No excuses. If you aren’t good at something, workharder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too. Dad went frombeing a football coach to a top salesperson. From there he becamethe boss, and ultimately, went on to own his own company.But I wasn’t given loads of instruction. From the beginning,gure it out. He was all about taking personalresponsibility. He didn’t hammer on us every night abouthomework; we just had to show up with the results. And, whenyou did, you were celebrated. If we got good grades, Dad tookus to Prings, an ice cream parlor where you could get theseking banana splits—six scoops of ice cr xings!Many times my siblings didn’t fare as well in school, so theydidn’t get to go. Getting to go was a big deal, so you workedyour butt off to win the trip.Dad’s discipline served as an example for me. Dad was myidol, and I wanted him to be proud of me. I also lived in fearof disappointing him. One of his philosophies is, “Be the guywho says ‘no.’ It’s no great achievement to go along with the
I never did drugs—he never harped on me about it, but I didn’twant to be that guy who just went along because everyoneelse was doing it. And I didn’t want to let Dad down.Thanks to Dad, by age 12, I’d mastered a schedule worthy ofthe most ef cient CEO. Sometimes I griped and moaned (I wasa kid!), but even then I secretly liked knowing that I had an edgeover my classmates. Dad gave me a serious head start on thediscipline and mentality it takes to be dedicated and responsible,to achieve whatever I set out to achieve. (It’s no accident that thetagline of SUCCESS magazine is “What Achievers Read.”) Today Dad and I joke about what an addictive overachiever hetrained me to be.  gure incomein my own business. By age twenty, I owned my own home inan upscale neighborhood. By age twenty-four, my income grewto more than $1 million a year, and by age twenty-seven, I wasof cially a self-made millionaire with a business that broughtin more than $50 million in revenue. That just about brings usto the present day, because I’m not yet forty, but I have enoughmoney and assets to last my family the rest of my life.“There are lots of ways to screw up a kid,” Dad says. “At least myway was a pretty good one! You seemed to have done pretty well.”So, while I admit that I’ve had to practice sitting on my hands andbeing present in the moment, or chilling out peacefully in a beachchair from time to time (without taking a pile of business books orself-improvement CDs with me), I’m grateful for the success skills Ilearned from my dad, and my other mentors along the way.The Compound Effect reveals the “secret” behind my success.I’m a true believer in the Compound Effect because Dad madesure that I lived it, each and every day, until I couldn’t live any 
other way if I tried. But if you’re like most people, you’re not a true believer. Thereare lots of perfectly understandable reasons why. You haven’thad the same coaching and example showing you what to do.You haven’t experienced the payoff of the Compound Effect.As a society, we have been deceived. We’ve been hypnotized bycommercial marketing, which convinces you of problems youxes to “cure” them.We’ve been socialized to believe in the fairy-tale endings foundin movies and novels. We’ve lost sight of the good, old-fashionedvalue of hard and consistent work.Let’s examine these hurdles one by one.You Haven’t Experienced the Payoffof the Compound Effect The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewardsfrom a series of small, smart choices. What’s most interesting aboutthis process to me is that, even though the results are massive,the steps, in the moment, don’t feel cant. Whether you’reusing this strategy for improving your health, relationships,nances, or anything else for that matter, the changes are sosubtle, they’re almost imperceptible. These small changes offerlittle or no immediate result, no big win, no obvious I-told-you-so payoff. So why bother?Most people get tripped up by the simplicity of the CompoundEffect. For instance, they quit after the eighth day of runningbecause they’re still overweight. Or, they stop practicing the
other than “Chopsticks.” Or, they stop making contributions totheir IRA after a few years because they could use the cash—and it doesn’t seem to be adding up to much anyway.What they don’t realize is that these small, seeminglycant steps completed consistently over time will create aradical difference. Let me give you a few detailed examples.Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCEThe Magic PennyIf you were given a choice between taking $3 million in cashthis very instant and a single penny that doubles in value everyday for 31 days, which would you choose? If you’ve heard thisbefore, you know the penny gambit is the choice you shouldmake—you know it’s the course that will lead to greater wealth.Yet why is it so hard to believe choosing the penny will result inmore money in the end?Because it takes so much longer to see the payoff. Let’s take a closer look. Let’s say you take the cold, hard cash and your friend goes thepenny route. On Day Five, your friend has sixteen cents. You,however, have $3 million. On Day Ten, it’s $5.12 versus yourbig bucks. How do you think your friend is feeling about herdecision? You’re spending your millions, enjoying the heck outof it, and loving your choice. After 20 full days, with only 11 days left, Penny Lane hasonly $5,243. How is she feeling about herself at this point? Force and positive behavior, she has barely more than$5,000. You, however, have $3 million. Then the invisible magic 
of the Compound Effect starts to become visible. The samesmall mathematical growth improvement each day makes thecompounded penny worth $10,737,418.24 on Day Thirty-one,more than three times your $3 million.In this example we see why consistency over time is so important. On Day Twenty-nine, you’ve got your $3 million;Penny Lane has around $2.7 million. It isn’t until Day Thirtyof this 31-day race that she pulls ahead, with $5.3 million. Andit isn’t until the very last day of this monthlong ultramarathon that your friend blows you out of the water; she ends up with$10,737,418.24 to your $3 million. Very few things are as impressive as the “magic” of compoundingpennies. Amazingly, this “force” is equally powerful in every areaof your life.Here’s another example…Three Friends Let’s take three buddies who all grew up together. They live inthe same neighborhood, with very similar sensibilities. Each makesaround $50,000 a year. They’re all married and have average healthand body weight, plus a little bit of that dr ab.”Friend number one, let’s call him Larry, plods along doing ashe’s always done. He’s happy, or so he thinks, but complainsoccasionally that nothing ever changes. Friend number two, Scott, starts making some small,seemingly inconsequential, positive changes. He beginsreading 10 pages of a good book per day and listening to
his commute to work. Scott wants to see changes in his life,but doesn’t want to make a fuss over it. He recently read aninterview with Dr. Mehmet Oz inSUCCESS magazine andchose one idea from the article to implement in his life: He’sgoing to cut 125 calories from his diet every day. No big deal.We’re talking maybe a cup of cereal less, trading that can ofsoda for a bottle of seltzer, switching from mayo to mustardon his sandwich. Doable. He’s also started walking a couplethousand extra steps per day (less than a mile). No grandacts of bravery or effort. Stuff anyone could do. But Scott isdetermined to stick with these choices, knowing that eventhough they’re simple, he could also easily be tempted toabandon them.Friend number three, Brad, makes a few poor choices. Herecently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more ofhis favorite programs. He’s been trying out the recipes he’sseen on the Food Channel—the cheesy casseroles and dessertsare his favorites. Oh, and he installed a bar in his family roomand added one alcoholic drink per week to his diet. Nothingcrazy; Brad just wants to have a little more fun.ve months, no perceivable differences existamong Larry, Scott, or Brad. Scott continues to read a little bitevery night and listen to audios during his commute; Brad is“enjoying” life and doing less. Larry keeps doing as he alwayshas. Even though each man has his own pattern of behavior vemonths isn’t long enough to see any real decline or improvementin their situations. In fact, if you charted the three men’s weights,you’d see a rounding error of zero. They’d look exactly equal.At the end of ten months, we still can’t see noticeable changes 
in any of their lives. It’s not until we get to the end of theeighteenth month that the slightest differences are measurablein these three friends’ appearances.ve, we start seeing reallymeasurable, visible differences. At month twenty-seven, we seean expansive difference. And, by month thirty-one, the change isstartling. Brad is now fat while Scott is trim. By simply cutting125 calories a day, in thirty-one months, Scott has lost thirty-three pounds!31 months = 940 days940 days x 125 calories/day = 117,500 calories saved117,500 calories saved x 1 pound/3,500 calories = 33.5 pounds! Brad ate only 125 more calories more a day in that sametime frame, and gained 33.5 pounds. Now he weighs67 pounds more than Scott! But the differences are moresignificant than weight. Scott’s invested almost one thousandhours reading good books and listening to self-improvementaudios; by putting his newly gained knowledge into practice,he’s earned a promotion and a raise. Best of all, his marriageis thriving. Brad? He’s unhappy at work, and his marriage ison the rocks. And Larry? Larry is pretty much exactly wherehe was two and half years ago, except now he’s a little morebitter about it.The phenomenal power of the Compound Effect is thatsimple. The difference between people who employ the
who allow the same effect to work against them is almostinconceivable. It looks miraculous! Like magic or quantumleaps. After thirty-one months (or thirty-one years), the personwho uses the positive nature of the Compound Effect appearsto be an “overnight success.” In reality, his or her profoundsuccess was the result of small, smart choices, completedconsistently over time.The Ripple Effect The results in the above example seem dramatic, I know. Butit goes even deeper than that. The reality is that even one smallcant impact that causes an unexpectedand unintended ripple effect. Let’s put one of Brad’s bad habitsunder the microscope—eating rich food more frequently—tobetter understand how the Compound Effect can also work ina negative way and can create a ripple effect that impacts yourentire life.Brad makes some muf ns from a recipe he learned from theFood Channel. He’s proud and his family loves it, and it seems toadd value all around. He starts making them (and other sweets)frequently. He loves his own cooking and eats more than hisshare—but not so much that anyone notices. However, the extrafood makes Brad sluggish at night. He wakes up a little groggy,which makes him cranky. The crankiness and sleep-deprivationbegin to impact his work performance. He’s less productive, andas a result, gets discouraging feedback from his boss. By the endof the day ed with his job and his energy level isway down. The commute home seems longer and more stressful 
than ever. All of this makes him reach for more comfort food—stress has a way of doing that.The overall lack of energy makes Brad less likely to take walkswith his wife, like he used to. He just doesn’t feel like it. Shemisses their time together and takes his withdrawal personally.With fewer shared activities with his wife and an absence offresh air and exercise, Brad’s not getting the endorphin releasethat had helped make him feel upbeat and enthusiastic. Becausehe’s not as happy nding fault with himself and others,and stops complimenting his wife. As his own body starts to feelabby, he feels less  dent, less attractive and becomesless romantic.Brad doesn’t realize how his lack of energy and affection towardhis wife affects her. He just knows that he feels funky. He starts losinghimself in late-night TV because it’s easy and distracting. Feeling hisdistance, Brad’s wife starts to complain, then becomes needy. Whenthat doesn’t work, she emotionally withdraws to protect herself.She’s lonely. She pours her energy into her work and spends morell her need for companionship. Menirting with her, which makes her feel desirable again. Shewould never cheat on Brad, but he has a feeling something’s wrong.Instead of seeing that his poor choices and behaviors are at the rootof their pr nds fault with his wife.Believing that the other person is wrong rather than lookinginside and doing the work necessary to clean up your mess isbasic Psychology 101 stuff. In Brad’s case, he doesn’t know to lookinside—they don’t offer self-improvement or relationship adviceon Top Chefor his favorite crime shows. However, the thought maybooks his buddy Scott read, he might have learned about ways to 
change negative habits. Unfortunately for Brad, the small choiceshe made on a daily basis created a ripple that wreaked havoc onevery area of his life.Of course, all that calorie-counting and intellectual stimulationhas had the opposite effect with Scott, who’s now reaping thebounty of positive results. It’s that simple. With enough timeand consistency, the outcomes become visible. Better yet, they’retotally predictable.Fig. 1Months        10      20          27Results:IncomeHealthRelationshipsHappinessSuccess27 MonthsChoices   Behavior   HabitsThe beauty of the Compound Effect is in its simplicity. Notice how,on the left side of the diagram, the results are intangible, but howpowerfully they differ later on. The behaviors all along the way areexactly the same, but the magic of the Compound Effect eventuallykicks in to bring massive differences in results.take a series of tiny steps, consistently, over time, to radically 
improve your life? Doesn’t that sound easier than musteringup some grand show of bravery and heroic strength, onlyto wear yourself out and have to drum up all that energyagain at a later date for another try (which will likely beunsuccessful)? I’m exhausted just thinking about it. But that’swhat people do. We’ve been conditioned by society to believein the effectiveness of a great display of massive effort. Heck,it’s downright all-American! See Figure 1.Success, Old SchoolThe most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that wehave to keep working away for a while, consistently and ef ciently,before we can begin to see the payoff. Our grandparents knew this,though they didn’t spend their evenings glued to the TV watchinginfomercials about how to have thin thighs in thirty days or a realestate kingdom in six months. I bet your grandparents workedsix days a week, from sunup to sundown, using the skills theylearned in their youth and repeatedly throughout their entire life.They knew the secret was hard work, discipline, and good habits.It’s interesting that wealth tends to skip a generation.Overwhelming abundance often leads to a lackadaisicalmentality, which brings about a sedentary lifestyle. Children ofthe wealthy are especially susceptible. They weren’t the oneswho developed the discipline and character to create the wealthrst place, so it makes sense that they may not have the
to keep it. We frequently see this entitlement mentality inchildren of royalty, movie stars, and corporate executives—and to a lesser degree, in children and adults everywhere.As a nation, our entire populace seems to have lostappreciation for the value of a strong work ethic. We’ve had two,if not three, generations of Americans who have known greatprosperity, wealth, and ease. Our expectations of what it reallytakes to create lasting success—things like grit, hard work, andfortitude—aren’t alluring, and thus have been mostly forgotten.We’ve lost respect for the strife and struggle of our forefathers.The massive effort they put forth instilled discipline, chiseledtheir character, and stoked the spirit to brave new frontiers.The truth is, complacency has impacted all great empires,including, but not limited to, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Spanish,Portuguese, French, and English. Why? Because nothing fails likesuccess. Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason.People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable.Having experienced extended periods of prosperity, health, andwealth, we become complacent. We stop doing what we did to getus there. We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn’tjump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental andinsidious that he doesn’t notice he’s getting cooked!If we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents’work ethic. It’s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of savingAmerica, at least for your own greater success and achievement.Don’t buy into the genie in a lamp idea. You can sit on your couchwaiting to attract checks in your mailbox, rub crystals together, re, channel that 2,000-year-old guru, or chant af rmations 
if you want to, but much of that is hocus-pocus commercialismmanipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses. Real andlasting success requires work—and lots of it!I have a quick, real-time story to illustrate this nothing-fails-likesuccess concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my homeon the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was alwaysimmaculate, the hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone,the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it),and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eatthere and would often wait more than an hour to be seated.Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take itssuccess for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staffdisheveled and curt, and the food quality hit-or-miss. The placewas out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing whatmade them successful to begin with. Their success clouded theirperspective and they slacked off.Microwave Mentality Understanding the Compound Effect will rid you of “insta-results” expectation—the belief success should be as fast asyour fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photoprocessing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, yourinstant hot water and text messaging. Enough, okay? Promise yourself that you’re going to let go once and for all of yourlottery-winner expectations because, let’s face it, you only hear storiesabout the one winner, not the millions of losers. That person you see
Santa Anita horse track doesn’t reveal the hundreds of times that sameperson lost. If we go back to our mathematical chance of a positiveresult, again, we have a rounding error of zero—as in, you have aboutzerochance of winning. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, authorof Stumbling on Happiness, says that if we gave lottery losers each thirtyseconds on TV to announce not, “I won!” but “I lost,” it would takealmost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing!When you understand how the Compound Effect works, youxes or silver bullets. Don’t try to fool yourselfinto believing that a mega-successful athlete didn’t live throughregular bone-crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice. Hegot up early to practice—and kept practicing long after all othershad stopped. He faced the sheer agony and frustration of the failure,loneliness, hard work, and disappointment it took to become No. 1.By the end of this book, or even before, I want you to know inyour bones that your only path to success is through a continuumof mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes dif cult dailydisciplines compounded over time. Know, too, that the results, thelife, and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours when you putthe Compound Effect to work for you. If you use the principlesoutlined in The Compound Effect, you will create your fairy taleending! See Figure 2.Have I made my point? Good. Join me in the next chapter,where we will focus on the one thing that controls your life.Every victory or defeat, triumph, or failure has started with this.Everything you have or don’t have in your life right now hasbeen because of this. Learn to change this, and you can changeyour life. Let’s discover what this is… Chapter_1.indd   Sec1:20CHAPTER 1  THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION

He’s happy, or so he thinks, but complainsoccasionally that nothing ever changes. Friend number two, Scott, starts making some small,seemingly inconsequential, positive changes. He beginsreading 10 pages of a good book per day and listening to
his commute to work. Scott wants to see changes in his life,but doesn’t want to make a fuss over it. He recently read aninterview with Dr. Mehmet Oz inSUCCESS magazine andchose one idea from the article to implement in his life: He’sgoing to cut 125 calories from his diet every day. No big deal.We’re talking maybe a cup of cereal less, trading that can ofsoda for a bottle of seltzer, switching from mayo to mustardon his sandwich. Doable. He’s also started walking a couplethousand extra steps per day (less than a mile). No grandacts of bravery or effort. Stuff anyone could do. But Scott isdetermined to stick with these choices, knowing that eventhough they’re simple, he could also easily be tempted toabandon them.Friend number three, Brad, makes a few poor choices. Herecently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more ofhis favorite programs. He’s been trying out the recipes he’sseen on the Food Channel—the cheesy casseroles and dessertsare his favorites. Oh, and he installed a bar in his family roomand added one alcoholic drink per week to his diet.

At month twenty-seven, we seean expansive difference. And, by month thirty-one, the change isstartling. Brad is now fat while Scott is trim.

Brad ate only 125 more calories more a day in that sametime frame, and gained 33.5 pounds. Now he weighs67 pounds more than Scott! But the differences are moresignificant than weight. Scott’s invested almost one thousandhours reading good books and listening to self-improvementaudios; by putting his newly gained knowledge into practice,he’s earned a promotion and a raise. Best of all, his marriageis thriving. Brad? He’s unhappy at work, and his marriage ison the rocks. And Larry? Larry is pretty much exactly wherehe was two and half years ago, except now he’s a little morebitter about it.The phenomenal power of the Compound Effect is thatsimple. The difference between people who employ the

After thirty-one months (or thirty-one years), the personwho uses the positive nature of the Compound Effect appearsto be an “overnight success.” In reality, his or her profoundsuccess was the result of small, smart choices, completedconsistently over time.The Ripple Effect The results in the above example seem dramatic, I know. Butit goes even deeper than that. The reality is that even one smallcant impact that causes an unexpectedand unintended ripple effect. Let’s put one of Brad’s bad habitsunder the microscope—eating rich food more frequently—tobetter understand how the Compound Effect can also work ina negative way and can create a ripple effect that impacts yourentire life.Brad makes some muf ns from a recipe he learned from theFood Channel. He’s proud and his family loves it, and it seems toadd value all around. He starts making them (and other sweets)frequently. He loves his own cooking and eats more than hisshare—but not so much that anyone notices. However, the extrafood makes Brad sluggish at night. He wakes up a little groggy,which makes him cranky. The crankiness and sleep-deprivationbegin to impact his work performance. He’s less productive, andas a result, gets discouraging feedback from his boss. By the endof the day ed with his job and his energy level isway down. The commute home seems longer and more stressful 
than ever. All of this makes him reach for more comfort food—stress has a way of doing that.The overall lack of energy makes Brad less likely to take walkswith his wife, like he used to. He just doesn’t feel like it. Shemisses their time together and takes his withdrawal personally.With fewer shared activities with his wife and an absence offresh air and exercise, Brad’s not getting the endorphin releasethat had helped make him feel upbeat and enthusiastic. Becausehe’s not as happy nding fault with himself and others,and stops complimenting his wife. As his own body starts to feelabby, he feels less  dent, less attractive and becomesless romantic.Brad doesn’t realize how his lack of energy and affection towardhis wife affects her. He just knows that he feels funky. He starts losinghimself in late-night TV because it’s easy and distracting. Feeling hisdistance, Brad’s wife starts to complain, then becomes needy. Whenthat doesn’t work, she emotionally withdraws to protect herself.She’s lonely. She pours her energy into her work and spends morell her need for companionship. Menirting with her, which makes her feel desirable again. Shewould never cheat on Brad, but he has a feeling something’s wrong.Instead of seeing that his poor choices and behaviors are at the rootof their pr nds fault with his wife.Believing that the other person is wrong rather than lookinginside and doing the work necessary to clean up your mess isbasic Psychology 101 stuff.

However, the thought maybooks his buddy Scott read, he might have learned about ways to 
change negative habits. Unfortunately for Brad, the small choiceshe made on a daily basis created a ripple that wreaked havoc onevery area of his life.Of course, all that calorie-counting and intellectual stimulationhas had the opposite effect with Scott, who’s now reaping thebounty of positive results. It’s that simple. With enough timeand consistency, the outcomes become visible.

I’m exhausted just thinking about it. But that’swhat people do. We’ve been conditioned by society to believein the effectiveness of a great display of massive effort. Heck,it’s downright all-American! See Figure 1.Success, Old SchoolThe most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that wehave to keep working away for a while, consistently and ef ciently,before we can begin to see the payoff. Our grandparents knew this,though they didn’t spend their evenings glued to the TV watchinginfomercials about how to have thin thighs in thirty days or a realestate kingdom in six months. I bet your grandparents workedsix days a week, from sunup to sundown, using the skills theylearned in their youth and repeatedly throughout their entire life.They knew the secret was hard work, discipline, and good habits.It’s interesting that wealth tends to skip a generation.Overwhelming abundance often leads to a lackadaisicalmentality, which brings about a sedentary lifestyle. Children ofthe wealthy are especially susceptible. They weren’t the oneswho developed the discipline and character to create the wealthrst place, so it makes sense that they may not have the
to keep it. We frequently see this entitlement mentality inchildren of royalty, movie stars, and corporate executives—and to a lesser degree, in children and adults everywhere.As a nation, our entire populace seems to have lostappreciation for the value of a strong work ethic. We’ve had two,if not three, generations of Americans who have known greatprosperity, wealth, and ease. Our expectations of what it reallytakes to create lasting success—things like grit, hard work, andfortitude—aren’t alluring, and thus have been mostly forgotten.We’ve lost respect for the strife and struggle of our forefathers.The massive effort they put forth instilled discipline, chiseledtheir character, and stoked the spirit to brave new frontiers.The truth is, complacency has impacted all great empires,including, but not limited to, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Spanish,Portuguese, French, and English. Why? Because nothing fails likesuccess. Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason.People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable.Having experienced extended periods of prosperity, health, andwealth, we become complacent. We stop doing what we did to getus there. We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn’tjump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental andinsidious that he doesn’t notice he’s getting cooked!If we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents’work ethic. It’s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of savingAmerica, at least for your own greater success and achievement.Don’t buy into the genie in a lamp idea. You can sit on your couchwaiting to attract checks in your mailbox, rub crystals together, re, channel that 2,000-year-old guru, or chant af rmations 
if you want to, but much of that is hocus-pocus commercialismmanipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses. Real andlasting success requires work—and lots of it!I have a quick, real-time story to illustrate this nothing-fails-likesuccess concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my homeon the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was alwaysimmaculate, the hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone,the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it),and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eatthere and would often wait more than an hour to be seated.Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take itssuccess for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staffdisheveled and curt, and the food quality hit-or-miss. The placewas out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing whatmade them successful to begin with. Their success clouded theirperspective and they slacked off.Microwave Mentality Understanding the Compound Effect will rid you of “insta-results” expectation—the belief success should be as fast asyour fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photoprocessing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, yourinstant hot water and text messaging. Enough, okay? Promise yourself that you’re going to let go once and for all of yourlottery-winner expectations because, let’s face it, you only hear storiesabout the one winner, not the millions of losers. That person you see
Santa Anita horse track doesn’t reveal the hundreds of times that sameperson lost. If we go back to our mathematical chance of a positiveresult, again, we have a rounding error of zero—as in, you have aboutzerochance of winning. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, authorof Stumbling on Happiness, says that if we gave lottery losers each thirtyseconds on TV to announce not, “I won!” but “I lost,” it would takealmost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing!When you understand how the Compound Effect works, youxes or silver bullets. Don’t try to fool yourselfinto believing that a mega-successful athlete didn’t live throughregular bone-crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice. Hegot up early to practice—and kept practicing long after all othershad stopped. He faced the sheer agony and frustration of the failure,loneliness, hard work, and disappointment it took to become No. 1.By the end of this book, or even before, I want you to know inyour bones that your only path to success is through a continuumof mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes dif cult dailydisciplines compounded over time. Know, too, that the results, thelife, and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours when you putthe Compound Effect to work for you. If you use the principlesoutlined in The Compound Effect, you will create your fairy taleending! See Figure 2.Have I made my point? Good. Join me in the next chapter,where we will focus on the one thing that controls your life.Every victory or defeat, triumph, or failure has started with this.Everything you have or don’t have in your life right now hasbeen because of this. Learn to change this, and you can changeyour life. Let’s discover what this is… Chapter_1.indd   Sec1:20The Compound Effect is always working. You can choose to make it 
work for you, or you can ignore it and experience the negative effectsof this powerful principle. It doesn’t matter where you are on thisgraph. Starting today, you can decide to make simple, positive changesand allow the Compound Effect to take you where you want to go.gentlemen, I’m the tortoise. Give me enough time, and I will 
beat virtually anybody, anytime, in any competition. Why?Not because I’m the best or the smartest or the fastest. I’ll winbecause of the positive habits I’ve developed, and because ofthe consistency I use in applying those habits. I’m the world’sbiggest believer in consistency. I’m living proof that it’s theultimate key to success, yet it’s one of the biggest pitfallsfor people struggling to achieve. Most people don’t knowhow to sustain it. I do. I have my father to thank for that. Inrst coach for igniting the power of theCompound Effect.My parents divorced when I was eighteen months old, andmy dad raised me as a single father. He wasn’t exactly the soft,he hard-wired me for achievement. 
Thanks to Dad, wake-up calls were at six o’clock everymorning. Not by a loving tap on the shoulder or even thesound of a radio alarm. No, I was awakened each morningby the repetitious pile-driving sound of iron pounding on theconcr oor of our garage, situated next to my bedroom.It was like waking up twelve feet from a construction zone.He’d painted a huge “No pain, no gain” sign on the wall of thegarage, which he stared at while he did countless old-schoolstrongman dead lifts, power cleans, lunges, and squats. Rain,sleet, or shine, Dad was out there in his shorts and tatteredsweatshirt. He never missed a day. You could set your watchby his routine.I had more chores than a housekeeper and gardener puttogether. Upon returning from school, there was always a listof instructions to greet me: pull weeds, rake leaves, sweep thegarage, dust, vacuum, do the dishes—you name it. And gettingbehind in school wasn’t tolerated. That’s just the way it was.Dad was the original “no excuses” guy. We weren’t everallowed to stay home from school sick, unless we were actuallypuking, bleeding, or “showing bone.” The term “showing bone”came from his coaching days; his players knew they weren’tallowed to come out of the game unless they were seriouslyinjured. One time his quarterback asked to be pulled out ofthe game. Dad said, “Not unless you’re showing bone.” Thequarterback pulled back his shoulder pads, and sure enough,his collarbone was showing. Only then was he allowed to comeof eld.One of Dad’s core philosophies was, “It doesn’t matter how 
smart you are or aren’t, you need to make up in hard work whatyou lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability. If yourcompetitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you justneed to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!”No matter what the challenge, he taught me to make up in hardwork for wherever I might be disadvantaged. Miss free throws atthe game? Do one thousand free throws every day for a month.Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right handbehind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in yourmath? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summeruntil you get it. No excuses. If you aren’t good at something, workharder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too. Dad went frombeing a football coach to a top salesperson. From there he becamethe boss, and ultimately, went on to own his own company.But I wasn’t given loads of instruction. From the beginning,gure it out. He was all about taking personalresponsibility. He didn’t hammer on us every night abouthomework; we just had to show up with the results. And, whenyou did, you were celebrated. If we got good grades, Dad tookus to Prings, an ice cream parlor where you could get theseking banana splits—six scoops of ice cr xings!Many times my siblings didn’t fare as well in school, so theydidn’t get to go. Getting to go was a big deal, so you workedyour butt off to win the trip.Dad’s discipline served as an example for me. Dad was myidol, and I wanted him to be proud of me. I also lived in fearof disappointing him. One of his philosophies is, “Be the guywho says ‘no.’ It’s no great achievement to go along with the
I never did drugs—he never harped on me about it, but I didn’twant to be that guy who just went along because everyoneelse was doing it. And I didn’t want to let Dad down.Thanks to Dad, by age 12, I’d mastered a schedule worthy ofthe most ef cient CEO. Sometimes I griped and moaned (I wasa kid!), but even then I secretly liked knowing that I had an edgeover my classmates. Dad gave me a serious head start on thediscipline and mentality it takes to be dedicated and responsible,to achieve whatever I set out to achieve. (It’s no accident that thetagline of SUCCESS magazine is “What Achievers Read.”) Today Dad and I joke about what an addictive overachiever hetrained me to be.  gure incomein my own business. By age twenty, I owned my own home inan upscale neighborhood. By age twenty-four, my income grewto more than $1 million a year, and by age twenty-seven, I wasof cially a self-made millionaire with a business that broughtin more than $50 million in revenue. That just about brings usto the present day, because I’m not yet forty, but I have enoughmoney and assets to last my family the rest of my life.“There are lots of ways to screw up a kid,” Dad says. “At least myway was a pretty good one! You seemed to have done pretty well.”So, while I admit that I’ve had to practice sitting on my hands andbeing present in the moment, or chilling out peacefully in a beachchair from time to time (without taking a pile of business books orself-improvement CDs with me), I’m grateful for the success skills Ilearned from my dad, and my other mentors along the way.The Compound Effect reveals the “secret” behind my success.I’m a true believer in the Compound Effect because Dad madesure that I lived it, each and every day, until I couldn’t live any 
other way if I tried. But if you’re like most people, you’re not a true believer. Thereare lots of perfectly understandable reasons why. You haven’thad the same coaching and example showing you what to do.You haven’t experienced the payoff of the Compound Effect.As a society, we have been deceived. We’ve been hypnotized bycommercial marketing, which convinces you of problems youxes to “cure” them.We’ve been socialized to believe in the fairy-tale endings foundin movies and novels. We’ve lost sight of the good, old-fashionedvalue of hard and consistent work.Let’s examine these hurdles one by one.You Haven’t Experienced the Payoffof the Compound Effect The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewardsfrom a series of small, smart choices. What’s most interesting aboutthis process to me is that, even though the results are massive,the steps, in the moment, don’t feel cant. Whether you’reusing this strategy for improving your health, relationships,nances, or anything else for that matter, the changes are sosubtle, they’re almost imperceptible. These small changes offerlittle or no immediate result, no big win, no obvious I-told-you-so payoff. So why bother?Most people get tripped up by the simplicity of the CompoundEffect. For instance, they quit after the eighth day of runningbecause they’re still overweight. Or, they stop practicing the
other than “Chopsticks.” Or, they stop making contributions totheir IRA after a few years because they could use the cash—and it doesn’t seem to be adding up to much anyway.What they don’t realize is that these small, seeminglycant steps completed consistently over time will create aradical difference. Let me give you a few detailed examples.Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCEThe Magic PennyIf you were given a choice between taking $3 million in cashthis very instant and a single penny that doubles in value everyday for 31 days, which would you choose? If you’ve heard thisbefore, you know the penny gambit is the choice you shouldmake—you know it’s the course that will lead to greater wealth.Yet why is it so hard to believe choosing the penny will result inmore money in the end?Because it takes so much longer to see the payoff. Let’s take a closer look. Let’s say you take the cold, hard cash and your friend goes thepenny route. On Day Five, your friend has sixteen cents. You,however, have $3 million. On Day Ten, it’s $5.12 versus yourbig bucks. How do you think your friend is feeling about herdecision? You’re spending your millions, enjoying the heck outof it, and loving your choice. After 20 full days, with only 11 days left, Penny Lane hasonly $5,243. How is she feeling about herself at this point? Force and positive behavior, she has barely more than$5,000. You, however, have $3 million. Then the invisible magic 
of the Compound Effect starts to become visible. The samesmall mathematical growth improvement each day makes thecompounded penny worth $10,737,418.24 on Day Thirty-one,more than three times your $3 million.In this example we see why consistency over time is so important. On Day Twenty-nine, you’ve got your $3 million;Penny Lane has around $2.7 million. It isn’t until Day Thirtyof this 31-day race that she pulls ahead, with $5.3 million. Andit isn’t until the very last day of this monthlong ultramarathon that your friend blows you out of the water; she ends up with$10,737,418.24 to your $3 million. Very few things are as impressive as the “magic” of compoundingpennies. Amazingly, this “force” is equally powerful in every areaof your life.Here’s another example…Three Friends Let’s take three buddies who all grew up together. They live inthe same neighborhood, with very similar sensibilities. Each makesaround $50,000 a year.

Herecently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more ofhis favorite programs. He’s been trying out the recipes he’sseen on the Food Channel—the cheesy casseroles and dessertsare his favorites.

Why? Because nothing fails likesuccess. Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason.People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable.Having experienced extended periods of prosperity, health, andwealth, we become complacent. We stop doing what we did to getus there. We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn’tjump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental andinsidious that he doesn’t notice he’s getting cooked!If we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents’work ethic. It’s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of savingAmerica, at least for your own greater success and achievement.Don’t buy into the genie in a lamp idea. You can sit on your couchwaiting to attract checks in your mailbox, rub crystals together, re, channel that 2,000-year-old guru, or chant af rmations 
if you want to, but much of that is hocus-pocus commercialismmanipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses. Real andlasting success requires work—and lots of it!I have a quick, real-time story to illustrate this nothing-fails-likesuccess concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my homeon the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was alwaysimmaculate, the hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone,the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it),and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eatthere and would often wait more than an hour to be seated.Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take itssuccess for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staffdisheveled and curt, and the food quality hit-or-miss. The placewas out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing whatmade them successful to begin with. Their success clouded theirperspective and they slacked off.Microwave Mentality Understanding the Compound Effect will rid you of “insta-results” expectation—the belief success should be as fast asyour fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photoprocessing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, yourinstant hot water and text messaging. Enough, okay? Promise yourself that you’re going to let go once and for all of yourlottery-winner expectations because, let’s face it, you only hear storiesabout the one winner, not the millions of losers. That person you see
Santa Anita horse track doesn’t reveal the hundreds of times that sameperson lost. If we go back to our mathematical chance of a positiveresult, again, we have a rounding error of zero—as in, you have aboutzerochance of winning. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, authorof Stumbling on Happiness, says that if we gave lottery losers each thirtyseconds on TV to announce not, “I won!” but “I lost,” it would takealmost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing!When you understand how the Compound Effect works, youxes or silver bullets. Don’t try to fool yourselfinto believing that a mega-successful athlete didn’t live throughregular bone-crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice. Hegot up early to practice—and kept practicing long after all othershad stopped.
