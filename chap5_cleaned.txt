CHAPTER 5 INFLU
ENCES Hopefully by now you understand exactly how importantyour choices are. Even those that seem insigni˜cant, whencompounded, can make an extreme impact on your life. We™vealso discussed the fact that you are 100 percent responsible foryour life. You alone are responsible for the choices you makeand the actions you take. That said, you must also realize yourchoices, behaviors, and habits are in˚uenced by very powerfulexternal forces. Most of us aren™t aware of the subtle controlthese forces have on our lives. For you to sustain your positivetrajectory toward your goals, you™ll need to understand andgovern these in˚uences so they will support rather than derailyour journey toward success. Everyone is affected by three kindsof in˚uences: input (what you feed your mind), associations(the people with whom you spend time), and environment(your surroundings).If you want your body to run at peak performance, you’ve 
got to be vigilant about consuming the highest-quality nutrientsand avoiding tempting junk food. If you want your brain toperform at its peak, you’ve got to be even more vigilant aboutwhat you feed it. Are you feeding it news summaries or mind-numbing sitcoms? Are you reading the tabloids, orSUCCESS? Controlling the input has a direct and measurable impact onyour productivity and outcomes.Controlling what our brains consume is especially dif cultbecause so much of what we take in is unconscious. Although it’strue that we can eat without thinking, it’s easier to pay attentionto what we put in our bodies because food doesn’t leap intoour mouths. We need an extra level of vigilance to prevent ourbrains from absorbing irrelevant, counterproductive or downrightdestructive input. It’s a never-ending battle to be selective andto stand guard against any information that can derail yourcreative potential.Your brain is not designed to make you happy. Your brainhas only one agenda in mind: survival. It is always watchingfor signs of “lack and attack.” Your brain is programmed to seekout the negative—dwindling resources, destructive weather,whatever’s out to hurt you. So when you switch on that radio onthe way to work and get bombarded with all those reports aboutr res, attacks, the tanking economy, your brain lightsup—it now will spend all day chewing over that feast of fear,worry, negativity. Same deal when you tune into the eveningnews after work. More bad news? Perfect! Your mind will stewon that all night long.

We can’t change ourDNA, but wecanchange our behavior. We can teach our mindsto look beyond “lack and attack.” How? We can protect and feedour mind. We can be disciplined and proactive about what weallow in.To identify the inﬂ uence that information and yourenvironment has on you, complete the InputInﬂ uences sheet Sheet on page 172, or download atwww.TheCompoundEffect.com/free.Don’t Drink Dirty WaterYou get in life what you create. Expectation drives the creativeprocess. What do you expect? You expect whatever it is you’rethinking about. Your thought process, the conversation in yourhead, is at the base of the results you create in life. So the questionis,What are you thinking about?uencing and directingyour thoughts? The answer: whatever you’re allowing yourself tohear and see. This is the input you are feeding your brain. Period.See Figure 12.Your mind is like an empty glass; it’ll hold anything you putinto it. You put in sensational news, salacious headlines, talk-show rants, and you’re pouring dirty water into your glass.If you’ve got dark, dismal, worrisome water in your glass,everything you cr ltered through that muddymess, because that’s what you’ll be thinking about. GarbageChapter_5.indd   121Chapter_5.indd   1214/21/10   1:03:35 PM4/21/10   1:03:35 PMin, garbage out. All that drive-time radio yak about murders, 
conspiracy, deaths, economy, and political battles drives yourthinking process, which drives your expectations, which drivesyour creative output. That IS bad news. But just like a dirtyush it with clean, clear water under the faucetlong enough, eventually you’ll end up with a glass of pure,clear water. What is that clear water? Positive, inspirational, andsupportive input and ideas. Stories of aspiration, people who,despite challenges, are overcoming obstacles and achievinggreat things. Strategies of success, prosperity, health, love,and joy. Ideas to create more abundance, to grow, expand, andbecome more. Examples and stories of what’s good, right, andpossible in the world. That’s why we work so hard atSUCCESSmagazine. We want to provide you with those examples, thosestories and the key take-aways you can use to improve yourFlush out the negative (dirty water) with positive, inspirational andsupportive ideas (clean water).Chapter_5.indd   122Chapter_5.indd   1224/22/10   4:11:06 PM4/22/10   4:11:06 PM123INFLUENCESview of the world, yourself, and the results you create. That’salso why I read something inspirational and instructional forthirty minutes in the morning and evening, and have personal-development CDs playing in my car ushing my glassand feeding my mind. Does this give me an edge over the guyrst thing reads the newspaper, listens tonews radio on his commute to and from work, and watches theevening news before going to bed? You bet it does! And it canfor you, too.Step 1: Stand GuardUnless you decide to hole up in a cave or on a desert island,you’re going to get dirty water in your glass. It’s going to be onbillboards, on CNN while you’re walking through the airport,on the screaming tabloid headlines at the checkout when you’rebuying groceries, etc. Even your friends, family members, and yourood dirty water into your glass.But that doesn’t mean you can’t take steps to limit your exposure to all that grime. Maybe you can’t avoid the tabloidsstacked up at the checkout register, but you can cancel yoursubscriptions. You can refuse to listen to the radio to and fromwork and instead put in an instructional and inspirational CD.You can turn off the evening news and talk to your loved onesinstead. You can buy a DVR and record only those programs youfeel are truly educational and life-af rming—and speed throughthe commercials aimed at making you feel inadequate or lackingunless you buy more crap.I didn’t really grow up with TV; I remember watchingSolid Gold and The A-Team(remember them?), but television wasn’t aChapter_5.indd   123Chapter_5.indd   1234/21/10   1:03:42 PMit, and that’s given me a clearer perspective when I watch an 
occasional program now. Sure, I’ll laugh along with the sitcom,but afterward, I feel the same as if I ate fast food—bloated andmalnourished. And I can’t get over how commercials prey onour psychology, our fears, pains, needs, and weaknesses. If Iwalk through life thinking that I’m not enough just as I am—thatI need to buy this, that, and the other thing to be okay—how canI expect to create amazing results?It’s estimated that Americans (twelve and older) spend 1,704hours watching TV per year. That averages out to 4.7 HOURSper day. We’re spending almost 30 percent of our waking hourswatching TV. Almost thirty-three hours per week—more thanone whole day each week! It’s the equivalent of watching TVfor two solid months out of every twelve! WOW! And peoplewonder why they can’t get ahead in life?Put Yourself on a Media DietThe media thrives on taking us hostage. Ever been stuck on the freeway with traf c backed up for miles, making you late,wondering what the heck’s holding everything up? Sure enough,nally get close, you see that nothing physical isow of cars; the wreck clearly happened a while agoand has since been moved to the side of the freeway. The 3-mphcrawl was caused by people rubbernecking! Now you’re reallyirritated. But what happens when your car passes the wreck? Youslow way down, take your eyes off the road in front of you, andcrane your own neck! Chapter_5.indd   124Chapter_5.indd   1244/21/10   1:03:46 PM4/21/10   1:03:46 PM125INFLUENCESWhy do good, decent people want to see something tragic and grotesque? It’s our genetic heritage, going back to our prehistoricsense of self-preservation. We can’t help ourselves. Even if we’readept at avoiding negativity, and have trained ourselves to berelentlessly positive, when it comes to sensationalism, our basicnature can’t resist. Media masters understand that. They knowyour nature, in many ways better than you. The media has alwaysused shocking and sensational headlines to draw attention. Buttoday, instead of three news TV and radio networks, there arehundreds, running 24/7. Instead of a few newspapers, there areendless portals reaching us from our computers to our phones.The competition for your attention has never been bloodier, andthe media jockeys continually up the ante in shock value. Theynd a dozen or so of the most heinous, scandalous, criminal,murderous, bleak, and horrid things that happen in the worldeach day, and parade them through our papers, news channels,and the Web over and over. Meanwhile, during that same twenty-four-hour period, millions of wonderful, beautiful, incrediblethings have happened. Yet we hear very little about them. Inbeing wired to seek out the negative, we create the demand formore and more. How could the positive news stories ever hopeto compete with those ratings or advertising dollars? Let’s go back to our freeway. Instead of a wreck on the side ofthe road, what if there was the most stunning, miraculous sunsetyou’ve ever seen? What would happen to the traf c then? I’veseen this many times. It whizzes by at top speed. The great danger of the media is that it gives us a veryperverted view of the world. Because the focus and therepetition of messaging is on the negative, that’s what our mindsChapter_5.indd   125Chapter_5.indd   1254/21/10   1:03:49 PM
working has a sever uence on your creative potential. It canbe crippling. My Personal Junk FilterI’ll share what I do to safeguard my mind. But I warn you, Ihave a rigorous mental diet. You’ll want to adjust to your ownpreferences, but this system has worked beautifully for me.As you might guess, I don’t watch or listen to any news andI don’t read any newspapers or news magazines. Ninety-ninepercent of all news has no bearing on my personal life or mypersonal goals, dreams, and ambitions anyway. I have set upa few RSS feeds identifying the news and industry updatesthat do pertain to my direct interests and goals. The news that’shelpful to me gets plucked out of the fray so I don’t have to getany mud slung into my glass of water. While most people wadethrough hours of irrelevant garbage that hampers their thinkingand crushes their spirit, I get the most productive information Ifteen minutes a day.Step 2: Enroll in Drive-Time UIt’s not enough to eliminate negative input. To move in apositive dir  ll up on thegood. My car won’t move without two things: gasoline and anever-present library of instructional CDs I listen to as I drive. Theaverage American drives about twelve thousand miles a year.That’s three hundr ushing potential right there!Brian Tracy taught me the concept of turning my car into a mobileChapter_5.indd   126Chapter_5.indd   1264/21/10   1:03:52 PM4/21/10   1:03:52 PM127INFLUENCESclassroom. He explained to me that by listening to instructionalCDs as I drive, I gain knowledge equivalent to two semesters ofan advanced college degree—every year. Think about it; usingthe time you’re currently wasting by listening to drive-time radio,you could obtain the equivalent of Ph.D. in leadership, salessuccess, wealth building, relationship excellence—or whatevercourse you choose. This commitment, in combination with yourreading routine, separates you from the herd of average—oneCD, DVD, or book at a time. II. Associations: Who’s Inﬂ uencing You?Bir ock together. The people with whom youhabitually associate are called your “reference group.” Accordingto research by social psychologist Dr. David McClelland ofHarvard, your “reference group” determines as much as 95percent of your success or failure in life.Who do you spend the most time with? Who are the peopleyou most admire? Are those two groups of people exactly thesame? If not, why not? Jim Rohn taught that we become theve people we hang around the most.Rohn would say we could tell the quality of our health, attitude,and income by looking at the people around us. The peoplewith whom we spend our time determine what conversationsdominate our attention, and to which attitudes and opinions weare regularly exposed. Eventually, we start to eat what they eat,talk like they talk, read what they read, think like they think,watch what they watch, treat people how they treat them, evendress like they dress. The funny thing is, more often than not, weChapter_5.indd   127Chapter_5.indd   1274/21/10   1:03:55 PM

Because your associations don’t shoveyou in a direction; they nudge you ever so slightly over time.uence is so subtle that it’s like being on an inner tubeout in the ocean, feeling like you’r oating in place, until youlook up and realize the gentle current has pushed you a half miledown the shore.Think of your friends who order greasy appetizers or acocktail before dinner, and that’s their routine. Hang out withnd yourself grabbing for cheesenachos and potato skins, and joining them for that extra beeror glass of wine, matching their pace. Meanwhile, your otherfriends order healthy food and talk about the inspiring booksthey’re reading and their ambitions in their businesses, and youbegin to assimilate their behaviors and habits. You read and talkabout what they talk about, you see the movies they’re excitedabout, and you go to the places they r uenceyour friends have over you is subtle and can be positive ornegative; either way, the impact is incredibly powerful. Watchout! You cannot hang out with negative people and expect tolive a positive life.So, what is the combined average income, health, or attitudesve people you spend most of your time with? Does theanswer frighten you? If so, the best way to increase your potentialfor whatever traits you desire is to spend the majority of your timewith people who already possess those traits. You will then seeuence work for you, rather than against you. Thebehaviors and attitudes which helped them acquire the successChapter_5.indd   128Chapter_5.indd   1284/21/10   1:03:58 PM4/21/10   1:03:58 PM129INFLUENCESyou admire will begin to become part of your daily routine. Hangaround them long enough, and you’re likely to realize similarsuccessful outcomes in your life.If you haven’t already ve people youhang around the most. Also write down their main characteristics,both positive and negative. It doesn’t matter who they are. It couldbe your spouse, your brother, your neighbor, or your assistant. Now,average them out. What’s their average health, and bank balance?What’s their average relationship like? As you look at your results,ask yourself, “Is this list okay for me? Is this where I want to go?”It’s time to reappraise and reprioritize the people you spend timewith. These relationships can nurture you, starve you, or keep youstuck. Now that you’ve started to carefully consider with whom youspend your time, let’s go a little deeper. As Jim Rohn taught me, it’spowerful to evaluate and shift your associations into three categories:dissociations, limited associations, and expanded associations.To evaluate your current associations, complete theAssociation Evaluator sheet on page 173, or download atwww.TheCompoundEffect.com/free.DissociationsYou guar uences your children are exposedto, and the people they hang around. You are aware of theuence these people could have on your children and thechoices they might make as a result. I believe this same principleshould apply to you! You already know this: There are somepeople you might need to break away from. Completely. ThisChapter_5.indd   129Chapter_5.indd   1294/21/10   1:04:01 PM4/21/10   1:04:01 PM
make the har uences affectyou anymore. Determine the quality of life you want to have,and then surround yourself with the people who represent andsupport that vision.I’m constantly weeding out of my life people who refuseto grow and live positively. Growing and changing yourassociations is a lifelong process. Some people might sayI’m too rigorous about it, but I’d like to be more so. I had abusiness relationship with someone I really liked, but when theeconomy got dif cult, most of his conversation was focused onhow horrible things were, how much his company was feelingthe hit, and how hard it was out there. I said, “Man, you’ve gotto stop working on your presentation about how bad life is.I can hear you collecting all the data points to reinforce yourbeliefs.” He persisted in seeing everything as more dour andhopeless than it was, and I decided we had no business doingbusiness together.When you make the tough decision to put up boundaries between you and people who drag you down, realize that they’llght you—especially those closest to you. Your decision to livea more positive, goal-oriented life will be a mirror to their ownpoor choices. You will make them uncomfortable and they willattempt to pull you back down to their level. Their resistancedoesn’t mean they don’t love you or want the best for you—it’sactually not about you at all. It’s about their fear and their guiltabout their own poor choices and lack of discipline. Just knowthat breaking away won’t be easy.Chapter_5.indd   130Chapter_5.indd   1304/21/10   1:04:04 PM4/21/10   1:04:04 PM131INFLUENCESLimited Associations There are some people you can spend three hours with,but not three days. Others you can spend three minutes with,but not three hours. Always r uence ofassociations is both powerful and subtle. The person you’rewalking with can determine whether you slow your pace orguratively. Similarly, you can’t helpbut be touched by the dominant attitudes, actions and behaviorsof the people with whom you spend time.Decide how much you can “affor uenced, based onhow those people represent themselves. This is dif cult, I know.I have had to do this on several occasions, even with close familymembers. I WILL NOT, however, allow someone else’s actionsuence on me.I’ve got a neighbor who’s a three-minute friend. For three minutes,we have a great chit-chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. Ican hang out with an old high-school friend for three hours, buthe’s not a three-day guy. And, then there are some people I can hangaround for a few days, but wouldn’t go on an extended vacationwith. Take a look at your relationships and make sure you’re notspending three hours with a three-minute person.Expanded Associations W uencers.While you’re doing that, you’ll also want toreachout. Identifypeople who have positive qualities in the areas of life where youwant to impr nancial and business successyou desire, the parenting skills you want, the relationships youChapter_5.indd   131Chapter_5.indd   1314/21/10   1:04:07 PM
with them. Join organizations and businesses and health clubswhere these people gather and make friends. Ahead, you’ll seehow I even used to drive to a different town to spend qualitytime—with fortuitous results.I rave about Jim Rohn throughout this book because,aside from my father, Jim remains my foremost mentor anduencer. My relationship with Jim perfectly  es anexpanded association. While I got to share a few private mealsand spend a little time with him during our interviews andbackstage before events, most of my time with Jim was spentlistening to him in my car or reading his words in my livingroom. I have spent more than a thousand hours getting directinstruction from Jim, and 99 percent of that was through booksand audio programs. What’s exciting about that is, no matterwhere you are in your life—maybe busy at home with smallchildren or caretaking aging parents, working long hours withpeople with whom you have little in common, or living out inthe country far from the nearest of ce building—you, too, canhave almost any mentor you want, if he or she has gatheredtheir best thoughts, stories, and ideas into books, CDs, DVDs,and podcasts. You have an unlimited bounty from which todraw. Take advantage of it.If you want to have a better, deeper, more meaningful relationship,ask yourself, “Who has the type of relationship I want? How canI spend (more) time with that person? Who can I meet who canuence me?” Let their glow rub off on you. Befriendthe person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful personeld. What do they read? Where do they go for lunch? HowChapter_5.indd   132Chapter_5.indd   1324/21/10   1:04:10 PM4/21/10   1:04:10 PM133INFLUENCES uence you? You can build these expandedassociations by joining networking groups, Toastmasters, andsimilar organizations. Find the charity organizations, symphonies,country clubs, where the people you want to emulate gather.Find a Peak-Performance PartnerAnother way to increase your exposure to expanded associationsis by teaming up with a peak performance partner, someone asequally committed to study and personal growth as you. Thisperson should be someone you trust, someone bold enough totell you what they really think about you, your attitudes, andperformance. It could be that this person is a longtime friend, buthe or she may be someone who doesn’t know you well at all. Thepoint is to get (and give) an unbiased, honest, outside perspective.My current “accountability partner” is my good friendLandon Taylor. As I mentioned before, we have a thirty-minutexes, “ah-has,” and where we are on our growth plans. The anticipationof the call and knowing I have to be accountable to Landonkeeps me extra committed throughout the week.I make a record of Landon’s losses or any feedback he needsand make sure to ask him about it the next week. He does thesame for me. That way we hold each other accountable. Hemight say, “Okay, you screwed up here last week and admittedit and committed to change. What did you do about that thisweek?” Life is life. We’re both busy executives, but it’s amazingto me that we actually end up doing this every week withoutfail. It’s not easy ying through my day andChapter_5.indd   133Chapter_5.indd   1334/21/10   1:04:13 PM
the call, I’ll think, “I’m so glad we’re having this conversation!”Even in preparing for it, and thinking of my big wins and lossesfor the week, I learn about myself. This week I told Landon,“You know, I’m in the middle of so many things. I’m writing mybook. I’m having a lot of realizations, and so many ah-has, butnot one thing that’s really compelling.” He said, “Let this be thelast week that you don’t come to the table with an ah-ha.” Gulp.“Don’t shortchange me,” he said. Point taken. In reality, I wasshortchanging myself by not identifying one thing memorableenough to share.I have a serious challenge for you if you’re up for it. Wantreal feedback? Find people who care enough about you to bebrutally honest with you. Ask them these questions: “How do Ishow up to you? What do you think my strengths are? In whatareas do you think I can improve? Where do you think I sabotaget methe most? What’s the one thing I should start doing?” Invest in Mentorship Paul J. Meyer is another man who served as a mentor to me. Paul passed away in 2009 at age eighty-one. Whenever I thoughtI was really doing things, really playing at a high level, I’d getaround Paul—he was my reality check. What he did beforelunch was mind-boggling to me. I got to spend a lot of timewith him; Paul bought one of my companies, and then I did aturnaround for one of his companies. He was a very powerfulspirit in my life. Chapter_5.indd   134Chapter_5.indd   1344/21/10   1:04:16 PM4/21/10   1:04:16 PM135INFLUENCESAfter spending a couple of hours with Paul, hearing about all his plans and ventures and activities, my head would spin. Justtrying to make sense of all he had going on exhausted me. Aftertime with Paul, I’d want to go take a nap! But my associationwith him raised my game. His walking pace was my runningpace. It expanded my ideas about how big I could play and howambitious I could be. You have to get around people like that!You’re never too good for a mentor. During my interview withHarvey Mackay, he told me, “I have had twenty coaches, if youcan believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, Ihave a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” Ihave always found it interesting that the most successful people,the truly top performers, are the ones willing to hire and pay forthe best coaches and trainers there are. It pays to invest in yourimproved performance.Finding and engaging a mentor doesn’t need to be a mysterious or intimidating process either. When I sat down withKen Blanchard, he explained the simplicity of engaging a mentor(SUCCESS rst thing you want to rememberwith a mentor is that it doesn’t need to take a lot of their time.The best advice I’ve ever gotten is in short clips, having lunchor breakfast with somebody, just telling them what I’m workingon and asking their advice and all. You will be amazed howsuccessful businesspeople are willing to be mentors to peoplewhen it’s not taking a lot of time.” John Wooden reinforces thepoint that others desire to be mentors (SUCCESS, September 2008): “Mentoring is your true legacy. It is the greatest inheritanceyou can give to others. And it should never end. It is why youget up every day. To teach and be taught.” He went on to explainChapter_5.indd   135Chapter_5.indd   1354/21/10   1:04:19 PM
be open to being mentored. It is our responsibility to be willingto allow our lives and our minds to be touched, molded, andstrengthened by the people who surround us.”Develop Your Own Personal Board of AdvisorsAs part of my plan to be wiser, more strategic, and operatemore effectively, as well as expand the time and interaction Ihave with high-minded leaders, I’ve been developing a board ofadvisors in my personal life. I’ve hand-selected a dozen people because of their areas ofexpertise, creative thinking ability, and/or my great respect forwho they are. Once a week I reach out to a few of them andsolicit ideas, run thoughts by them, and ask for feedback andinput. Having started this pr tsI’ve already received have been profound—far more than Ianticipated! It’s surprising the genius people are willing to sharewhen you show sincere interest.Who should be on your personal board of advisors? Seekout positive people who have achieved the success you want tocreate in your own life. Remember the adage: “Never ask adviceof someone with whom you wouldn’t want to trade places.” III. Environment: Changing Your ViewChanges Your PerspectiveWhen I was in real estate, working in the East Bay of SanFrancisco, I lived and worked within a very limited demographic. Chapter_5.indd   136Chapter_5.indd   1364/21/10   1:04:22 PM4/21/10   1:04:22 PM137INFLUENCESI saw the same kinds of people operating at the same level overand over nd an elevated circle ofassociations in order to go where I wanted to go.I started driving across the bay to one of the richest and mostbeautiful spots on the planet, Tiburon in Marin County, north ofSan Francisco. If you’ve ever been to Monaco, that’s what Tiburonlooks like, but far quainter. It’s a spectacular spot. I would go to adelightful seafood restaurant, Sam’s on the Wharf. The food wasgreat, but more importantly, the restaurant was popular with thearea’s more af uent residents.Aside from going to Sam’s to expand my associations, I’d alsosit on the wharf and look up at the hillside. I was mesmerizedby the multimillion-dollar houses that hung off the cliffs. One inparticular always caught my eye—a blue, four-story home withan elevator and a whale lightning rod at the top.What would be the perfect house? I used to ask myself all the time. If someone could just give me one of them, which one would I pick? The answer was always the same—this beautiful blue one. It was in the perfectspot with a bright vista, the best of the bunch. On my way home from brunch one morning, I saw an open housesign and thought it’d be fun to check it out. One sign led to anotheras I followed them zigzagging up the cliffs along the narrow streets.nally reached the top of the hill and found the advertised home.As I entered and walked up to a spectacular bay window, the worldopened up in front of me—the peninsula tip of Tiburon, AngelIsland across the Bay, Berkeley and the East Bay, the Bay Bridge,and the entire San Francisco skyline over to the Golden Gate Bridgein a 300-degree expanse. I walked out onto the balcony and lookedaround. Suddenly I realized that this was the very house I’d beenChapter_5.indd   137Chapter_5.indd   1374/21/10   1:04:26 PM4/21/10   1:04:26 PM
