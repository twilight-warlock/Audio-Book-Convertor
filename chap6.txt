CHAPTER 6ACCE
LERAT
ION 
When I lived in La Jolla, California, for exercise and a test of 
will, I would regularly my bike two miles straight up Mount 
Soledad. There are very few things you can do voluntarily that 

cause more pain and suffering than riding a bike up a steep 

mountain without stopping. There is a point at which you ﬁhit 

the wallﬂ and come face to face with your true inner character. 

Suddenly, all the projections and ideas you had about yourself are 

stripped away and you™re left with the naked truth. Your mind 

starts inventing all sorts of convenient alibis on why it™s okay 

to stop. It is then when you™re faced with one of life™s greatest 

questions: Do you push through the pain and continue on, or 

will you crack like a walnut and give up? Lance Armstrong was the 
SUCCESS cover feature in June 
2009. I remember watching Lance during his ˜rst Tour de France 

victory. The Tour had entered the grueling mountain stages of 
142THE COMPOUND EFFECTthe race. The other riders dismissed Lance, because he had never 
been a renowned climber. During the third mountain ascent 

through freezing rains, mist, and then hail, Lance got separated 

fr ghting the top climbers in the 

 nal ascent, eighteen miles straight up into 

Sestrier ve and a half hours climbing mountains, every 

rider was suffering. Each needed to search the depths of his 

 nition—could they endure? It became a test 

of who could best survive the har nd the strength to 

keep going—who would crack and who wouldn’t. W ve miles to go, Lance was thirty-two seconds behind the 
leaders, an eternity while climbing a mountain on a bike. During 

a curve, Lance stood up and surged ahead until he caught the two 

leaders—both established world-class climbers. Having expended 

almost everything he had in him, Lance then launched an attack 

and gained several lengths on the leaders. He later said in his 

book It’s Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life
 (Putnam, 2000), 
“When you open a gap and your competitors don’t respond, it 

tells you something. They’re hurting. And when they’re hurting, 

that is when you take them.” Completely exhausted, struggling 

to breathe, his legs and arms burning with fatigue, Lance kept 

pounding the pedals. Some tried, but no one could catch him, they 

just didn’t have it in them.  nish line, with  sts pumping 

in the air, the unexpected contender won the stage race and 

ultimately the Tour de France. 
In this chapter I want to talk to you about those moments of truth and how the Compound Effect can help you break 

through to new and greater levels of success—faster than you 

imagined possible. When you’ve prepared, practiced, studied,

and consistently put in the required effort, sooner or later you’ll 

be presented with your own moment of truth. In that moment, 

 ne who you are and who you are becoming. It is in 

those moments where growth and improvement live—when we 

either step forward or shrink back, when we climb to the top 

of the podium and seize the medal or we continue to applaud 
sullenly from the crowd for others’ victories. 
We’ll also look at how you can consistently deliver more than 
people expect, compounding your good fortune even further. 
Moments of Truth 
“There is a point in every race when a rider encounters his real 
opponent and understands that it’s himself,” writes Lance in his 
autobiography. “In my most painful moments on the bike, I am 

at my most curious, and I wonder each and every time how I will 
respond. Will I discover my innermost weakness, or will I seek 

out my innermost strength?” 
When I was in real estate, I hit the wall several times a day. 
While driving to an expired listing property, after just getting 

pummeled by the last prospect, I’d start conjuring up all sorts of 

excuses to skip the sales call and head back to the of ce. While 

out canvassing a neighborhood, dogs would snarl at me or it 

looked like it might start to rain. I’d be in the midst of “money 
time” (5 to 9 p.m., cold-calling) and frequently get chewed out 

for interrupting someone’s dinner or favorite TV show. I was 

sure I needed to take a break to go to the bathroom or get a glass 

of water. But instead of quitting, every time I hit one of those 

mental and emotional walls, I recognized that my competitors

Chapter_6.indd   1434/21/10   1:04:49 PM

4/21/10   1:04:49 PM144THE COMPOUND EFFECTwere facing the same challenges. I knew this was another moment 

that, if I kept going, I would be strides ahead of them. These were 

 ning moments of success and progress. It wasn’t dif cult, 
painful, or challenging when I was just running with the herd, 

just keeping up, but not really getting ahead. It’s not getting to 

the wall that counts; it’s what you do after you hit it. Lou Holtz, the famous football coach, knew it was what 
you did after you did your best that created victories. In one 

game his team was down 42-0 at halftime. During the half-
time break, Lou showed his team a dramatic highlight reel 

of second efforts to block, tackle, and recover the ball. He 

then told the players that they were not on his team because 

they could give their all on every play; every player on every 

team does that. He said they were on 
his team because of their 
ability to make that critical extra effort on each play. It’s the 

extra effort after you have done your best that is the difference 

maker. His team went on to win the game in the second half. 

That is how you win. 
Muhammad Ali was one of the gr ghters of all time, 
not only because of his speed and agility, but also because of 

his strategy. On October 30, 1974, Ali regained his heavyweight 

championship, besting George Foreman in one of the biggest 

upsets in boxing history in the “Rumble in the Jungle.” Almost 

no one, not even Ali’s longtime supporter Howard Cosell, 

believed the former champion had a chance of winning. Both 

Joe Frazier and Ken Norton had beaten Ali previously, and 

George Foreman had knocked both of them out in only the 

second round. Ali’s strategy? To take advantage of the younger 

champion’s weakness—his lack of staying power. Ali knew if he

Chapter_6.indd   1444/21/10   1:04:52 PM

could get Foreman to his wall, he could then take the advantage. 

This is when Ali came up with the tactic later termed “Rope-a-

Dope.” Ali would lean on the ropes, shielding his face, while 

Foreman threw hundreds of punches over seven rounds. By 

the eighth round, Foreman was exhausted; he was at his wall. 

It was then that Ali dropped Foreman with a combination at 

center ring. 
Hitting the wall isn’t an obstacle; it’s an opportunity. During 
Lance Armstrong’s second attempt at winning the Tour de France, 

 rst big 

climb would be where Lance had experienced a devastating crash 

earlier that same year, giving him a concussion and breaking his 

seventh lumbar vertebra during a wet day in the spring. Now it 
was raining yet again. Instead of being concerned or hesitant, he 
said, “This is perfect attacking weather, mainly because I know 

the others don’t like it. I believe that nobody in the world is better 
at suffering. It’s a good day for me.” He was right. Lance brought 

home his second victory. 
When conditions are great, things are easy, there aren’t any 
distractions, no one is interrupting, temptations aren’t luring, 

and nothing is disturbing your stride; that too is when most 
everyone else does great. It’s not until situations are dif cult, 

when problems come up and temptation is great, that you get 

to prove your worthiness for progress. As Jim Rohn would say, 

“Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better.” 
When you hit the wall in your disciplines, routines, rhythms, 
and consistency, realize that’s when you are separating yourself 

fr nding your new 

powerful, triumphant, and victorious self. Chapter_6.indd   145

4/21/10   1:04:56 PM146THE COMPOUND EFFECTMultiplying Your Results 
I have an exciting opportunity for you. We’ve talked about 
how the simple disciplines and behaviors will compound over 
time, delivering amazingly powerful results for you. What if you 

could speed up the process and multiply your results? Would 

you be interested? I want to show you how just a little bit more 

effort can add exponentially to your outcomes. 
Let’s say you’re weight training and your program calls for you 
to do twelve repetitions of a certain weight. Now, if you do the 

twelve, you’r lling the expectation of your program. Great 

job. Stay consistent, and ultimately, you will see this discipline 

compound into powerful results for you. Yet, if you get to twelve, 

even if you’ve hit your max, and you push out another three to 

 ve reps, your impact on that set will be multiplied several times. 

You won’t just add a few reps to the aggregate of your workout. 

No. Those reps done after you hit your max will 
multiply your results. You’ve just pushed through the wall of your max. The 

previous reps just got you there. The real growth happens with 

what you do after you’re at the wall. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger made famous a weight training 
method called “The Cheating Principle.” Arnold was a stickler 

for perfect technique. He contended that once you reached 

your maximum number of lifts in perfect form, adjusting 

your wrists or leaning back to recruit other muscles to assist 

the working muscles (cheating a little) would allow you to 

 ve or six more r cantly improve 

the results of that set. (You can also achieve this by having a 

workout partner who assists the last few reps you couldn’t 

have done on your own.)

If you’re a runner, you know the experience. You get to the 
goal you set for yourself that day, and you’re feeling the burn, 

you’re at your wall, but you go a little farther, a little longer. This 

“little longer” is really a massive expansion of your limits. You 

have multiplied the results of that single run. 
Take the magic penny we talked about in Chapter 1, the 
one that doubles in value each day, showing you the result of 

small compounded actions. If you just doubled that penny one 
extra time per week during those same thirty-one days, the 
compounded penny would result in $171 million instead of $10 

million. Again, just extra effort in four days and the result was 

many times greater. That is how the math of doing just a little bit 

more than expected works. 
Viewing yourself as your toughest competitor is one of the best 
ways to multiply your results. Go above and beyond when you 

hit the wall. Another way to multiply your results is pushing past 

what other people expect of you—doing more than “enough.” 
Beat the Expectations Oprah is famous for using this principle—blasting beyond 
anyone’s expectations with her generosity and ability to live and 

work in a BIG way. Do you remember how she launched her 

nineteenth season in September 2004? When it comes to Oprah, 

we know to expect some fanfare… but she blew everyone away. 

That season opener was all the media or anyone else talked about 

for days afterward. 
Let’s go back in time for a minute…. The audience members were selected because their friends and family members had

4/21/10   1:05:02 PM148THE COMPOUND EFFECTwritten in saying each of them desperately needed a new car. 

Oprah opened the show by calling eleven people to the stage. 
She gave every one of them a car—a 2005 Pontiac G6. Then the 
real surprise: She surpassed everyone’s expectations when she 

distributed gift boxes to the rest of the audience saying one of the 

boxes contained a key to the twelfth car. But when the audience 

members opened their boxes, every one of them had a set of keys. 
She screamed, “Everybody gets a car! Everybody gets a car!” 
While this might be her most famous example, Oprah continues to go beyond our expectations in most everything 
she does. In other segments, Oprah surprised a twenty-year-old 

girl who had spent years in foster care and homeless shelters 

with a four-year college scholarship, a makeover and $10,000 in 

clothes. And, she gave a family with eight foster children who 

were going to be kicked out of their house $130,000 to pay for 

and repair their home. 
Now you might be saying, yeah, but she’s Oprah, of course she 
can do those things. But the truth is there are plenty of others in 

 nances and the fame—who could do 

those things, but never venture into the realm of extraordinary. 

Oprah does. That’s what makes her Oprah. Take a lesson from her. 

You can do more than expected in every aspect of your life. 
When it was time to propose to my wife, Georgia, I could have 
done what was expected and met with her father to ask for his 
daughter’s hand in marriage. Instead, I decided to pay great 

respect to her father by preparing my speech in Portuguese (I got 

Georgia’s sister to translate what I wanted to say). He understood 

English well enough, but wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. 

All the way up to Los Angeles from San Diego, I rehearsed the

words. I walked thr owers and treats 
and asked her dad to join us in the living room. I then delivered 
my memorized speech. Thankfully, he said, “Yes!” 
But I didn’t stop there. On the way back, and over the next 
couple of days, I called each one of her FIVE brothers and also 
asked for their blessing to join the family. Some were easy to 
convince, others proceeded to have me “earn it.” The point 
is, she told me later that one of the most special aspects about 
how I proposed was how I had honored her dad and how I had 
called every one of her brothers (and had her sister teach me 
Portuguese). That made the act extra special. The result of that 
extra effort paid off exponentially.

reputation on the line when he decided to acquire

Media. During one of the most challenging economies in recent 
history, and as print publishing was being seen as unfavorable, 
the move in itself was bold and audacious, but then he did even 
more than could be expected. While the new business enterprise

and his primary business was taking a couple steps backward 
like the rest of the world during the economic tsunami of 2008 
and 2009, Stuart launched a nonpr t foundation dedicated 
to kids. If he was going to make a commitment to helping 
teach the fundamentals of personal development to the world, 
he wanted to be especially sure that information would 
reach teenagers. So he launched the SUCCESS Foundation

Stuart personally funded the administration and management  rst year, with the help 

of a few good friends, he funded the distribution of more than 

1 million books. Today, that number is far greater and growing! 

Now, Stuart was already in for a heavy investment and big 

risk without the burdens of funding the new foundation. But 

the additional contribution and dedication to the foundation 
multiplied the statement of his commitment several-fold to 
potential partners, the press, his peers, and his own staff. He was 

doing far more than expected—and it spoke volumes. 
Where in life can you do more than expected when you hit the 
wall? Or where can you go for “WOW”? It doesn’t take a lot more 

effort, but the little extra multiplies your results many times over. 

Whether you’re making calls, serving customers, recognizing your 

team, acknowledging your spouse, going for a run, bench pressing, 

planning a date night, sharing time with your kids, whatever… 

what’s the little extra you can do that exceeds expectations and 

accelerates your results? 
Do the Unexpected 
I’m a contrarian by nature, I know. Tell me what everyone 
else does, what’s the consensus and what’s popular, and I will 

typically do the opposite. If everyone is zigging, I’m gonna zag. 
To me, what’s popular is average, it’s what’s common. Common 
Chapter_6.indd   150

things deliver common results. The most popular restaurant 

is McDonald’s, the most popular drink is Coca-Cola, the most 
popular beer is Budweiser, the most popular wine is Franzia 

(yeah, the stuff that comes in a box!). Consume those “popular” 

things, and you’ll be part of the common, average pack. But that’s 
ordinary. There’s nothing wrong with ordinary. I just prefer to 

shoot for extraordinary. 
For instance, everyone sends Christmas cards. But, since 
everyone does, it doesn’t really have much emotional impact, in 

my opinion. So I choose to send Thanksgiving cards instead. 

How many Thanksgiving cards do you get? Exactly. It makes 

a statement. And instead of bulk-printed, computer-generated 

“best wishes” cards, I handwrite personal sentiments expressing 

how grateful I am for my relationship with that person and what 

he or she means to me—same effort, but a much greater impact. 
Richard Branson built his career on doing the unexpected. I 
love to watch him launch a new company. Each stunt is bolder, 

scarier, and mor ying 

a hot air balloon around the globe or driving a tank down Fifth 

Avenue in New York to introduce Virgin Cola to the United 

States, Richard always delivers the unexpected. He could get by 

with the expected press release, a press conference or two, and 

some swanky party, and call it a day, but instead he goes for the 

astonishing. He probably spends as much as (and sometimes 

even less than) other companies do to launch a product; he just 

does it in unexpected style. The wow-factor makes a statement 

and multiplies the impact of his efforts. 
More often than not, the extra effort doesn’t cost that 
much more money or energy. When I was selling real estate,

up. Instead, I got in my car and showed up on their doorstep 

and hand-delivered a “SOLD” sign. “Take this,” I’d say when 

they’d open the door. “You’ll need it if you hire me to take 

over this listing.” For the price it took to keep my gas tank 

full, I immediately and exponentially increased my chance of 

getting the listing. 
Recently Alex, a friend of mine, was up for a big job. He lives in 
 nal twelve 

candidates. They were going to interview local candidates in person 

and those out of the area via video conferencing. He called me, 

asking if I knew how to facilitate a Web camera video conference. 
“How badly do you want this job?” I asked him. 
“It’s my dream job,” Alex told me. “It’s everything I’ve spent 
 ve years preparing to do.” 
“Then get on a plane and show up in person.” I said. 
“No need,” Alex said, “They’r ying in the  nal three for a 
last interview.”

should separate yourself by doing the unexpected. Fly across the 

country on a moment’s notice and show up in person. That’s 
how you make a statement.” If I set my sights on something, I’m going to ensure success 
by going all in and all out. I launch what I call “shock and 
awe” campaigns. During this same job hunt I suggested Alex 

pull out all the stops—attack from every possible front and do 

it relentlessly. 
“Research all the decision makers,” I told him. “Find out their 
interests, hobbies, kids’ hobbies, spouses’ hobbies, neighbors’

hobbies, etc. Send them books, articles, gifts, and other resources 

that you think they might like. ‘Is this over the top?’ Heck yes, 

that’s the point. They’ll know you’re trying to butter them up, but 

they’ll appreciate your gumption and creativity—you’ll certainly 

get their attention and most likely, their respect.” Then I continued: 

“Research all the people in the organization. Take that list and run 

it by your entire network to see if they know anyone who might 

know someone in this organization. Search every name against 

your LinkedIn database. Find a few people to connect with. Talk 

with them and ask them to put in a good word for you. Send 

them gifts, notes, and other things, and ask them to hand-deliver 

these things to the decision makers. Phone, e-mail, fax, text, tweet, 

Facebook, etc., them during the process. Could this be overly 

aggressive? Heck, yes! But I have found that you may lose one out 

 ve for being too aggressive, but you get the other four!” 
By the way, Alex did not take my advice, and he did not

unequivocally say he was a far better choice than the person the 

organization hired, but Alex failed to make an impression, and 

it cost him his dream job. 
I’m on the board of a company that needed a congressman

political axe he was grinding against others who publicly favored 

the issue. Instead of making any more futile appeals to sway 

him, I suggested we go above his head and talk to his boss—his 
wife. We went through our network until one person led us to 

someone who was friends with his wife. We then waited for her

Tuesday that following week and the company got its project. 
In our attention-deficit, propaganda-saturated society, 
sometimes doing the unexpected is required to get your voice 

heard. If you have a cause or ideal worthy of attention, do what 

it takes, even the unexpected, to make your case heard. Add a 

little audacity to your repertoire. 
Do Better Than Expected Invisible Children (www.InvisibleChildren.com), another 
nonprofit for which I’m a board member, helps rescue and 

recuperate children who have been abducted and made soldiers 

in northern Uganda and the Congo. To gain awareness for their 

cause, they staged a hundred-city event called “The Rescue,” 

where more than eight hundred thousand young people camped 

outside until prominent leaders of the community came to 

“rescue them,” thus gaining their attention and support. After 

four days, all but one city had been rescued, having people like 

U.S. Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, Val Kilmer, Kristen Bell, 

and many others show up in ninety-nine other cities. The last 

city to get rescued was Chicago, and it required Oprah. After six 

days, Oprah was a no-show. On the fourth day, they organized 

a march that went round and round her studios. The next day 

they put on a singing and dancing presentation that went on

all day and night. Then the sixth day, having endured harsh 

weather and sleeping in the rain, the mor ve hundred 

participants surrounded her studio and stood in silence holding 

signs starting at 3:30 a.m. That morning Oprah walked out the 
doors of Harpo Studios, spoke with the organization’s founders 

and invited the entire group to participate in a live broadcast 

segment that morning to her more than 20 million viewers. That 

attention got Invisible Children on 
Larry King Live and 232 other news outlets—to reach a total of more than 65 million people. A 

bill is currently moving through Congress supporting Invisible 

Children’s efforts to save these children. The organization had 

already pulled off more than expected with the Rescue event, 

but the little extra gumption and steadfastness to capture that 

last city (and the attention of Oprah), gained Invisible Children 

its biggest advocate to date, multiplying its results many 

times over. 
Find the line of expectation and then exceed it. Even when it 
comes to the small stuff—or maybe especially then. Whatever 

I think the dress standard is going to be for any event, for 

example, I always choose to go at least one step above it. When 

I am unsure of the attire, I always err on the side of dressing 

better than I suppose the occasion calls for. Simple, I know, 

but it’s just one way I try to meet my standard to always do 

and be better than expected. 
When I do keynotes for large companies, I spend a considerable 
amount of time preparing—learning about their organization, 

products, markets, and their expectations for my talk. My goal

excellence multiplies your results in the marketplace many 

times over. 
I did some work with a CEO whose philosophy was to pay people, including his vendors and suppliers, a few days in 
advance of the contract commitment. I was always blown away 
when I received a check on the twenty-seventh of the month 

from him for next month’s payment. When I asked him about it, 

he said the obvious, “It’s the same money, but the surprise and 

good will it buys is immeasurable—why wouldn’t you?”This is one of the reasons why I admire Steve Jobs so much. Of all 
the sensational people we’ve featured on the cover of 
SUCCESS, Jobs is one of my favorites. Whatever your expectations are 

about the next Apple product launch, Jobs always has a little (or 

a lot of) something extra to WOW you. In the grand scheme of 
things, it might be only a minor addition, but even so, it’s better 
than expected and multiplies the impression and response from 

his customers and deepens their loyalty. In a world where most 

 cantly accelerate 

your results and stand out from the pack by doing better than 

expected. I like the boldness of what Robert Schuller told us 
in his SUCCESS feature (December 2008), “I say no idea is 
worthwhile if it doesn’t start with ‘Wow!’ ” 
Nordstrom is famous for this standard. When it comes to 
customer service, they always strive to do better than expected. 
Nordstrom has been known to take back an item that a customer 

bought more than a year ago, without a receipt, and in some 

cases, purchased at a different store! Why would they do that? 

Because they know exceeding expectations builds trust and

creates customer loyalty. As a result, they’ve developed an 

extraordinary reputation that continues to attract attention. After 

all, I’m reminding you of it here. The 
multiplier keeps growing! 
I challenge you to adopt these philosophies in your own life—in your daily habits, disciplines and routines. Giving a 

little more time, energy, or thought to your efforts won’t just 

improve your results; it will multiply them. It takes very little 

extra to be EXTRAordinary. In all areas of your life, look for the 

multiplier opportunities where you can go a little further, push 

yourself a little harder, last a little longer, prepare a little better,

Pick a peak-performance partner. Decide when, how 
 

regularly, and what you will hold each other accountable 
to, and what ideas you will expect the other to bring to 
each conversation. 
Identify the three areas of your life you are most focused 
 

on improving. Find and engage a mentor in each of 
those areas. Your mentors could be people who have 
accomplished what you wish to and with whom you have 
brief conversations, or they could be experts who have 
written down their ideas in books or recorded their ideas 
on CDs.

appreciation, etc.).

4/21/10   1:05:34 PMCONCLUSION Learning without execution is useless. I didn’t write this book 
for my own amusement (this is hard work!) or even to simply 

“motivate” you. Motivation without action leads to self-delusion. 

As I said in the introduction, the Compound Effect and the results it 

will manifest in your life are the real deal. Never again will you wish 

 nd you. The Compound Effect is a tool 

that, when combined with consistent, positive action, will make a real 

and lasting difference in your life. Let this book and its philosophy 

become your guide. Let the ideas and success strategies sink in and 

produce genuine, tangible, measurable outcomes for you. Whenever 

you realize small, seemingly innocuous poor habits have crept back 

into your life, take out this book. Whenever you fall off the wagon of 

consistency, take out this book. Whenever you want to reignite your 

motivation and bolster your why-power, take out this book. Every 

time you read this book, it entices Big Mo to pay a visit to your life. 
Let me share with you what motivates me. My core value in 
 cance. My desire is to make a positive difference in 

other people’s lives. So to accomplish my goals, I need you to accomplish your goals. It is your testimonial of life-changing Conclusion_.indd   159

 ve or ten years 

from now), to tell me about the incredible results you’ve realized 

because of ideas you gained from this book. Only then will I 

know I have accomplished my goals, my objectives—that I am 
living up to my core values in life. 
For you to get those results (and me, my testimonial), I know 
you have to take immediate action on your new insights and 

knowledge. Ideas uninvested are wasted. I don’t want that to 

happen. It’s now time to act on your new convictions. You now 

have the power, and I expect you to seize it! 
You 
are
 ready to make dramatic improvements, right? Of 
course, the obvious answer is, “YES!” But you know by now that 
saying you’re ready to make the necessary changes and actually 

making them isn’t the same thing. To get different results, you’re 

going to have to do things differently. 
No matter where you ar nd this 
book, if I could, I’d ask you these simple questions: “Look back on 

 ve years ago. Are you 
now where you’d thought you’d 
 ve years later? Have you kicked the bad habits you had vowed 

to kick? Are you in the shape you wanted to be? Do you have the 

cushy income, the enviable lifestyle, and the personal freedom 

you expected? Do you have the vibrant health, abundant loving 

relationships, and the world-class skills you’d intended to have 

by this point in your life?” If not, why? Simple—choices. It’s time

continuum of the last. Choose to change your life, once and for all.

You’ve got no more excuses. Like me, you too will refuse to be 

 x 

enticements. You will stay focused on the simple but profound 

disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your desires. 

You know that success isn’t easy or overnight. You understand 

that when you’re committed to making moment-to-moment 

positive choices (despite the lack of visible or instant results), the 

Compound Effect 
will catapult you to heights that will astound 
you, bewilder your friends, family, and your competition. When 

you hold true to your why-power and stay consistent with your 

new behaviors and habits, momentum will carry you swiftly 
forward. And then, together, with that momentum and consistent, 

 ve years to be 

more of the same. On the contrary, when you put the Compound 

Effect to work for you, you will experience a success I’m willing 

to bet you currently cannot imagine! It will be incredible. 
I have one more valuable success principle to pass along to you. 
Whatever I want in life, I’ve found that the best way to get it is to 

focus my ener dence, 

I look for ways to help someone else feel mor dent. If I want 

to feel more hopeful, positive, and inspired, I try to infuse that in 

someone else’s day. If I want more success for myself, the fastest 

way to get it is to go about helping someone else obtain it. 
The ripple effect of helping others and giving generously of your 
time and ener ciary of your 

personal philanthropy.  rst simple and small step I’d like 

you to take in improving the trajectory of your life, I ask you to try

Your values are your GPS navigation system for life. Getting them de˜ned and properly calibrated is one of the 
most important steps in redirecting your life toward your grandest vision. The below series of questions will 
help you evaluate and re˜ne what is truly important to you and what matters most in life. Answer each question 
thoughtfully, and then I will help you select the top half-dozen values for your life.
Who is the person I respect most in life? What are their core values?  
 
 
Who is my best friend, and what are his/her top three qualities? 
 
 
If I could have more of any one quality instantly, what would it be?  
 
What are three things I hate? (e.g., cruelty to animals, credit card companies, deforestation, etc.) 
 
 
Which three people in the world do I dislike the most and why? 
 
 
 
Which personality trait, attribute or quality do people compliment me on the most?

WORKSHEET #9 Œ The GRAND Design 
GUIDELINES
Subtle and seemingly inconsequential adjustments transform wishes and aspirations into results.
1. Don™t Just Think ItŠINK IT
 
The weakest ink is stronger than the strongest mind. Unless you write down your goals, they are often lost in the 
shu˜e and excitement of new problems, challenges and decisions. Eliminate outside interruptions.
ﬁReduce your plan to writing.... The moment you complete this, you will have de˜nitely given concrete form to the intangible 
desire.ﬂ 
ŠNapoleon Hill 
2. Suspend Reality
 
Pretend it is only a game; play in fantasy for a while. Let the giant that lay dormant inside you out to play. If you 
had every skill, resource or ability in the world, what would you do? What would you set out to accomplish? Don™t 
˚lter, qualify or judge. 
ﬁThe same thinking that has led you to where you are is not going to lead you to where you want to go.ﬂ
 ŠA
lbert 
E
instein
Remember: Do not prejudge your ability or worthiness to have and achieve whatever your mind conceives. Let 
your thoughts ˛ow.
**Understand
Šyou are not committing yourself to everything, or anything, you write down at ˚rst. Y
ou 
are brainstorming, letting your imagination take a stroll. There will be time to separate out the outrageous and 
absurd, but to start, just play with reckless abandon. If a genie popped out of a lamp and could grant you 10 wishes 
in every one of these categories, what would you write down? Go for it, play full out!
3. Think Big
 
Give yourself permission to dream big, risk big. What would you go for if you knew success was guaranteed? If you 
could write the script for your character™s role in lifeŠand it could be 
anything
Šwhat role would you write for 
yourself? What™s your secret ambition? What have you always wanted to do, have, be, experience, but have been 
too afraid?
What is your BHA
G? 
Your Big Hairy Audacious Goal. What is that one thing that even the thought of it makes 
your palms sweat a little?
Expect little and, as a result, receive little.
ﬁThe greater danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we hit it.ﬂ 
~Michelangelo
