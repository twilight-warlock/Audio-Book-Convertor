CHAPTER 1 THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
You know that expression, “Slow and steady wins the race”? 
Ever heard the story of the tortoise and the hare? Ladies and 

gentlemen, I’m the tortoise. Give me enough time, and I will 

beat virtually anybody, anytime, in any competition. Why? 

Not because I’m the best or the smartest or the fastest. I’ll win 

because of the positive habits I’ve developed, and because of 

the consistency I use in applying those habits. I’m the world’s 

biggest believer in consistency. I’m living proof that it’s the 

ultimate key to success, yet it’s one of the biggest pitfalls 

for people struggling to achieve. Most people don’t know 

how to sustain it. I do. I have my father to thank for that. In 

 rst coach for igniting the power of the 

Compound Effect. 
My parents divorced when I was eighteen months old, and 
my dad raised me as a single father. He wasn’t exactly the soft,

he hard-wired me for achievement. 
Thanks to Dad, wake-up calls were at six o’clock every 
morning. Not by a loving tap on the shoulder or even the 

sound of a radio alarm. No, I was awakened each morning 

by the repetitious pile-driving sound of iron pounding on the 

concr oor of our garage, situated next to my bedroom. 

It was like waking up twelve feet from a construction zone. 

He’d painted a huge “No pain, no gain” sign on the wall of the 

garage, which he stared at while he did countless old-school 

strongman dead lifts, power cleans, lunges, and squats. Rain, 

sleet, or shine, Dad was out there in his shorts and tattered 

sweatshirt. He never missed a day. You could set your watch 

by his routine. 
I had more chores than a housekeeper and gardener put 
together. Upon returning from school, there was always a list 

of instructions to greet me: pull weeds, rake leaves, sweep the 

garage, dust, vacuum, do the dishes—you name it. And getting 

behind in school wasn’t tolerated. That’s just the way it was. 
Dad was the original “no excuses” guy. We weren’t ever 
allowed to stay home from school sick, unless we were actually 

puking, bleeding, or “showing bone.” The term “showing bone” 

came from his coaching days; his players knew they weren’t 

allowed to come out of the game unless they were seriously 

injured. One time his quarterback asked to be pulled out of 

the game. Dad said, “Not unless you’re showing bone.” The 

quarterback pulled back his shoulder pads, and sure enough, 

his collarbone was showing. Only then was he allowed to come 

of eld.

4/21/10   1:38:13 PM7THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
One of Dad’s core philosophies was, “It doesn’t matter how 
smart you are or aren’t, you need to make up in hard work what 

you lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability. If your 

competitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you just 

need to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!” 

No matter what the challenge, he taught me to make up in hard 

work for wherever I might be disadvantaged. Miss free throws at 

the game? Do one thousand free throws every day for a month. 

Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right hand 

behind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in your 

math? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summer 

until you get it. No excuses. If you aren’t good at something, work 

harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too. Dad went from 

being a football coach to a top salesperson. From there he became 

the boss, and ultimately, went on to own his own company. 
But I wasn’t given loads of instruction. From the beginning, 
 gure it out. He was all about taking personal 

responsibility. He didn’t hammer on us every night about 

homework; we just had to show up with the results. And, when 

you did, you were celebrated. If we got good grades, Dad took 

us to Prings, an ice cream parlor where you could get these 

king banana splits—six scoops of ice cr xings! 

Many times my siblings didn’t fare as well in school, so they 

didn’t get to go. Getting to go was a big deal, so you worked 

your butt off to win the trip. 
Dad’s discipline served as an example for me. Dad was my 
idol, and I wanted him to be proud of me. I also lived in fear 

of disappointing him. One of his philosophies is, “Be the guy 

who says ‘no.’ It’s no great achievement to go along with the

Chapter_1.indd   74/21/10   1:38:14 PM

4/21/10   1:38:14 PM8THE COMPOUND EFFECTcrowd. Be the unusual guy, the extraordinary guy.” That’s why 

I never did drugs—he never harped on me about it, but I didn’t 

want to be that guy who just went along because everyone 

else was doing it. And I didn’t want to let Dad down. 
Thanks to Dad, by age 12, I’d mastered a schedule worthy of 
the most ef cient CEO. Sometimes I griped and moaned (I was 

a kid!), but even then I secretly liked knowing that I had an edge 

over my classmates. Dad gave me a serious head start on the 
discipline and mentality it takes to be dedicated and responsible, 

to achieve whatever I set out to achieve. (It’s no accident that the 
tagline of SUCCESS magazine is “What Achievers Read.”) Today Dad and I joke about what an addictive overachiever he 
trained me to be.  gure income 

in my own business. By age twenty, I owned my own home in 

an upscale neighborhood. By age twenty-four, my income grew 

to more than $1 million a year, and by age twenty-seven, I was 

of cially a self-made millionaire with a business that brought 

in more than $50 million in revenue. That just about brings us 

to the present day, because I’m not yet forty, but I have enough 

money and assets to last my family the rest of my life. 
“There are lots of ways to screw up a kid,” Dad says. “At least my 
way was a pretty good one! You seemed to have done pretty well.” 
So, while I admit that I’ve had to practice sitting on my hands and 
being present in the moment, or chilling out peacefully in a beach 

chair from time to time (without taking a pile of business books or 

self-improvement CDs with me), I’m grateful for the success skills I 

learned from my dad, and my other mentors along the way. 
The Compound Effect reveals the “secret” behind my success. 
I’m a true believer in the Compound Effect because Dad made

sure that I lived it, each and every day, until I couldn’t live any 

other way if I tried. But if you’re like most people, you’re not a true believer. There 
are lots of perfectly understandable reasons why. You haven’t 

had the same coaching and example showing you what to do. 
You haven’t experienced the payoff of the Compound Effect. 

As a society, we have been deceived. We’ve been hypnotized by 

commercial marketing, which convinces you of problems you 

 xes to “cure” them. 

We’ve been socialized to believe in the fairy-tale endings found 

in movies and novels. We’ve lost sight of the good, old-fashioned 

value of hard and consistent work. 
Let’s examine these hurdles one by one. 
You Haven’t Experienced the Payoff 

of the Compound Effect The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards 
from a series of small, smart choices. What’s most interesting about 

this process to me is that, even though the results are massive, 

the steps, in the moment, don’t feel cant. Whether you’re 
using this strategy for improving your health, relationships, 

 nances, or anything else for that matter, the changes are so 

subtle, they’re almost imperceptible. These small changes offer 

little or no immediate result, no big win, no obvious I-told-you-

so payoff. So why bother? 
Most people get tripped up by the simplicity of the Compound 
Effect. For instance, they quit after the eighth day of running 

because they’re still overweight. Or, they stop practicing the 
Chapter_1.indd   9

Chapter_1.indd   94/21/10   12:58:16 PM

4/21/10   12:58:16 PM10THE COMPOUND EFFECTpiano after six months because they haven’t mastered anything 

other than “Chopsticks.” Or, they stop making contributions to 

their IRA after a few years because they could use the cash—

and it doesn’t seem to be adding up to much anyway. 
What they don’t realize is that these small, seemingly 
 cant steps completed consistently over time will create a 

radical difference. Let me give you a few detailed examples. 
Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE
 The Magic Penny 
If you were given a choice between taking $3 million in cash 
this very instant and a single penny that doubles in value every 
day for 31 days, which would you choose? If you’ve heard this 

before, you know the penny gambit is the choice you should 

make—you know it’s the course that will lead to greater wealth. 

Yet why is it so hard to believe choosing the penny will result in 

more money in the end? 
Because it takes so much longer to see the payoff. Let’s take a closer look. Let’s say you take the cold, hard cash and your friend goes the 
penny route. On Day Five, your friend has sixteen cents. You, 

however, have $3 million. On Day Ten, it’s $5.12 versus your 

big bucks. How do you think your friend is feeling about her 
decision? You’re spending your millions, enjoying the heck out 

of it, and loving your choice. After 20 full days, with only 11 days left, Penny Lane has 
only $5,243. How is she feeling about herself at this point? For 
 ce and positive behavior, she has barely more than 
Chapter_1.indd   10

Chapter_1.indd   104/21/10   12:58:18 PM

4/21/10   12:58:18 PM11THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
$5,000. You, however, have $3 million. Then the invisible magic 

of the Compound Effect starts to become visible. The same 

small mathematical growth improvement each day makes the 

compounded penny worth $10,737,418.24 on Day Thirty-one, 
more than three times your $3 million. 
In this example we see why consistency over time is so important. On Day Twenty-nine, you’ve got your $3 million; 

Penny Lane has around $2.7 million. It isn’t until Day Thirty 

of this 31-day race that she pulls ahead, with $5.3 million. And 

it isn’t until the very last day of this monthlong ultramarathon that your friend blows you out of the water; she ends up with 
$10,737,418.24 to your $3 million. Very few things are as impressive as the “magic” of compounding 
pennies. Amazingly, this “force” is equally powerful in every area 

of your life. 
Here’s another example… 
Three Friends Let’s take three buddies who all grew up together. They live in 
the same neighborhood, with very similar sensibilities. Each makes 

around $50,000 a year. They’re all married and have average health 

and body weight, plus a little bit of that dr ab.” 
Friend number one, let’s call him Larry, plods along doing as 
he’s always done. He’s happy, or so he thinks, but complains 

occasionally that nothing ever changes. Friend number two, Scott, starts making some small, 
seemingly inconsequential, positive changes. He begins 

reading 10 pages of a good book per day and listening to 
Chapter_1.indd   11

Chapter_1.indd   114/21/10   12:58:19 PM

4/21/10   12:58:19 PM12THE COMPOUND EFFECT30 minutes of something instructional or inspirational on 

his commute to work. Scott wants to see changes in his life, 

but doesn’t want to make a fuss over it. He recently read an 

interview with Dr. Mehmet Oz in 
SUCCESS magazine and 
chose one idea from the article to implement in his life: He’s 

going to cut 125 calories from his diet every day. No big deal. 

We’re talking maybe a cup of cereal less, trading that can of 

soda for a bottle of seltzer, switching from mayo to mustard 

on his sandwich. Doable. He’s also started walking a couple 

thousand extra steps per day (less than a mile). No grand 

acts of bravery or effort. Stuff anyone could do. But Scott is 

determined to stick with these choices, knowing that even 

though they’re simple, he could also easily be tempted to 

abandon them. 
Friend number three, Brad, makes a few poor choices. He 
recently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more of 

his favorite programs. He’s been trying out the recipes he’s 

seen on the Food Channel—the cheesy casseroles and desserts 

are his favorites. Oh, and he installed a bar in his family room 

and added one alcoholic drink per week to his diet. Nothing 

crazy; Brad just wants to have a little more fun. 
 ve months, no perceivable differences exist 
among Larry, Scott, or Brad. Scott continues to read a little bit 

every night and listen to audios during his commute; Brad is 
“enjoying” life and doing less. Larry keeps doing as he always 
has. Even though each man has his own pattern of behavior ve 

months isn’t long enough to see any real decline or improvement 

in their situations. In fact, if you charted the three men’s weights, 

you’d see a rounding error of zero. They’d look exactly equal.

4/21/10   12:58:22 PM13THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
At the end of ten months, we still can’t see noticeable changes 
in any of their lives. It’s not until we get to the end of the 

eighteenth month that the slightest differences are measurable 

in these three friends’ appearances. 
 ve, we start seeing really 
measurable, visible differences. At month twenty-seven, we see 

an expansive difference. And, by month thirty-one, the change is 

startling. Brad is now fat while Scott is trim. By simply cutting 

125 calories a day, in thirty-one months, Scott has lost thirty-

three pounds! 
31 months = 940 days
940 days x 125 calories/day = 117,500 calories saved 
117,500 calories saved x 1 pound/3,500 calories = 33.5 pounds! Brad ate only 125 more calories more a day in that same 
time frame, and gained 33.5 pounds. Now he weighs 

67 pounds more than Scott! But the differences are more 

significant than weight. Scott’s invested almost one thousand 

hours reading good books and listening to self-improvement 

audios; by putting his newly gained knowledge into practice, 

he’s earned a promotion and a raise. Best of all, his marriage 

is thriving. Brad? He’s unhappy at work, and his marriage is 

on the rocks. And Larry? Larry is pretty much exactly where 

he was two and half years ago, except now he’s a little more 

bitter about it. 
The phenomenal power of the Compound Effect is that 
simple. The difference between people who employ the

4/21/10   12:58:24 PM14THE COMPOUND EFFECTCompound Ef t compared to their peers 

who allow the same effect to work against them is almost 

inconceivable. It looks miraculous! Like magic or quantum 

leaps. After thirty-one months (or thirty-one years), the person 

who uses the positive nature of the Compound Effect appears 

to be an “overnight success.” In reality, his or her profound 

success was the result of small, smart choices, completed 

consistently over time. 
The Ripple Effect The results in the above example seem dramatic, I know. But 
it goes even deeper than that. The reality is that even one small 

 cant impact that causes an unexpected 

and unintended ripple effect. Let’s put one of Brad’s bad habits 

under the microscope—eating rich food more frequently—to 

better understand how the Compound Effect can also work in 

a negative way and can create a ripple effect that impacts your 

entire life. 
Brad makes some muf ns from a recipe he learned from the 
Food Channel. He’s proud and his family loves it, and it seems to 

add value all around. He starts making them (and other sweets) 

frequently. He loves his own cooking and eats more than his 

share—but not so much that anyone notices. However, the extra 

food makes Brad sluggish at night. He wakes up a little groggy, 

which makes him cranky. The crankiness and sleep-deprivation 

begin to impact his work performance. He’s less productive, and 

as a result, gets discouraging feedback from his boss. By the end 

of the day ed with his job and his energy level is

Chapter_1.indd   144/21/10   12:58:26 PM

4/21/10   12:58:26 PM15THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
way down. The commute home seems longer and more stressful 

than ever. All of this makes him reach for more comfort food—

stress has a way of doing that. 
The overall lack of energy makes Brad less likely to take walks 
with his wife, like he used to. He just doesn’t feel like it. She 
misses their time together and takes his withdrawal personally. 

With fewer shared activities with his wife and an absence of 

fresh air and exercise, Brad’s not getting the endorphin release 

that had helped make him feel upbeat and enthusiastic. Because 
he’s not as happy nding fault with himself and others, 

and stops complimenting his wife. As his own body starts to feel 

 abby, he feels less  dent, less attractive and becomes 

less romantic. 
Brad doesn’t realize how his lack of energy and affection toward 
his wife affects her. He just knows that he feels funky. He starts losing 

himself in late-night TV because it’s easy and distracting. Feeling his 

distance, Brad’s wife starts to complain, then becomes needy. When 

that doesn’t work, she emotionally withdraws to protect herself. 

She’s lonely. She pours her energy into her work and spends more 

 ll her need for companionship. Men 

 irting with her, which makes her feel desirable again. She 

would never cheat on Brad, but he has a feeling something’s wrong. 

Instead of seeing that his poor choices and behaviors are at the root 
of their pr nds fault with his wife. 
Believing that the other person is wrong rather than looking 
inside and doing the work necessary to clean up your mess is 

basic Psychology 101 stuff. In Brad’s case, he doesn’t know to look 

inside—they don’t offer self-improvement or relationship advice 

on Top Chef
 or his favorite crime shows. However, the thought may

4/21/10   12:58:28 PM16THE COMPOUND EFFECThave occurred to him that, if he had read the personal-development 
books his buddy Scott read, he might have learned about ways to 

change negative habits. Unfortunately for Brad, the small choices 

he made on a daily basis created a ripple that wreaked havoc on 

every area of his life. 
Of course, all that calorie-counting and intellectual stimulation 
has had the opposite effect with Scott, who’s now reaping the 

bounty of positive results. It’s that simple. With enough time 

and consistency, the outcomes become visible. Better yet, they’re 

totally predictable.

The beauty of the Compound Effect is in its simplicity. Notice how, 
on the left side of the diagram, the results are intangible, but how 

powerfully they differ later on. The behaviors all along the way are 

exactly the same, but the magic of the Compound Effect eventually 

kicks in to bring massive differences in results.

4/22/10   4:07:19 PM17THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
The Compound Effect is predictable and measurable—
that’s great news! Isn’t it comforting to know you only need to 

take a series of tiny steps, consistently, over time, to radically 

improve your life? Doesn’t that sound easier than mustering 

up some grand show of bravery and heroic strength, only 

to wear yourself out and have to drum up all that energy 

again at a later date for another try (which will likely be 

unsuccessful)? I’m exhausted just thinking about it. But that’s 

what people do. We’ve been conditioned by society to believe 

in the effectiveness of a great display of massive effort. Heck, 

it’s downright all-American! See Figure 1.
Success, Old School 
The most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that we 
have to keep working away for a while, consistently and ef ciently, 

before we can begin to see the payoff. Our grandparents knew this, 

though they didn’t spend their evenings glued to the TV watching 

infomercials about how to have thin thighs in thirty days or a real 

estate kingdom in six months. I bet your grandparents worked 

six days a week, from sunup to sundown, using the skills they 

learned in their youth and repeatedly throughout their entire life. 

They knew the secret was hard work, discipline, and good habits. 
It’s interesting that wealth tends to skip a generation. 
Overwhelming abundance often leads to a lackadaisical 

mentality, which brings about a sedentary lifestyle. Children of 

the wealthy are especially susceptible. They weren’t the ones 

who developed the discipline and character to create the wealth 

 rst place, so it makes sense that they may not have the 
Chapter_1.indd   17

Chapter_1.indd   174/21/10   12:58:32 PM

4/21/10   12:58:32 PM18THE COMPOUND EFFECTsame sense of value for wealth or understand what’s necessary 

to keep it. We frequently see this entitlement mentality in 

children of royalty, movie stars, and corporate executives—

and to a lesser degree, in children and adults everywhere. 
As a nation, our entire populace seems to have lost 
appreciation for the value of a strong work ethic. We’ve had two, 

if not three, generations of Americans who have known great 

prosperity, wealth, and ease. Our expectations of what it really 

takes to create lasting success—things like grit, hard work, and 

fortitude—aren’t alluring, and thus have been mostly forgotten. 

We’ve lost respect for the strife and struggle of our forefathers. 

The massive effort they put forth instilled discipline, chiseled 

their character, and stoked the spirit to brave new frontiers. 
The truth is, complacency has impacted all great empires, 
including, but not limited to, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Spanish, 

Portuguese, French, and English. Why? Because nothing fails like 

success. Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason. 

People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable. 
Having experienced extended periods of prosperity, health, and 
wealth, we become complacent. We stop doing what we did to get 

us there. We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn’t 

jump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental and 

insidious that he doesn’t notice he’s getting cooked! 
If we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents’ 
work ethic. It’s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of saving 
America, at least for your own greater success and achievement. 

Don’t buy into the genie in a lamp idea. You can sit on your couch

 re, channel that 2,000-year-old guru, or chant af rmations 

if you want to, but much of that is hocus-pocus commercialism 

manipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses. Real and 
lasting success requires work—and lots of it! 
I have a quick, real-time story to illustrate this nothing-fails-like 
success concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my home 

on the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was always 

immaculate, the hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone, 

the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it), 

and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eat 

there and would often wait more than an hour to be seated. 
Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take its 
success for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staff 

disheveled and curt, and the food quality hit-or-miss. The place 

was out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing what 

made them successful to begin with. Their success clouded their 

perspective and they slacked off. 
Microwave Mentality Understanding the Compound Effect will rid you of “insta-
results” expectation—the belief success should be as fast as 

your fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photo 
processing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, your 

instant hot water and text messaging. Enough, okay? Promise yourself that you’re going to let go once and for all of your 
lottery-winner expectations because, let’s face it, you only hear stories 

about the one winner, not the millions of losers. That person you see

4/21/10   12:58:36 PM20THE COMPOUND EFFECTjumping up and down in front of the Vegas slot machine or at the 

Santa Anita horse track doesn’t reveal the hundreds of times that same 

person lost. If we go back to our mathematical chance of a positive 

result, again, we have a rounding error of zero—as in, you have about 

zero
 chance of winning. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, author 

of Stumbling on Happiness, says that if we gave lottery losers each thirty 
seconds on TV to announce not, “I won!” but “I lost,” it would take 

almost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing! 
When you understand how the Compound Effect works, you 
 xes or silver bullets. Don’t try to fool yourself 

into believing that a mega-successful athlete didn’t live through 

regular bone-crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice. He 

got up early to practice—and kept practicing long after all others 

had stopped. He faced the sheer agony and frustration of the failure, 

loneliness, hard work, and disappointment it took to become No. 1. 
By the end of this book, or even before, I want you to know in 
your bones that your only path to success is through a continuum 

of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes dif cult daily 

disciplines compounded over time. Know, too, that the results, the 

life, and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours when you put 

the Compound Effect to work for you. If you use the principles 

outlined in The Compound Effect, you will create your fairy tale 
ending! See Figure 2.

for people struggling to achieve. Most people don’t know 

how to sustain it. I do. I have my father to thank for that. In 

 rst coach for igniting the power of the 

Compound Effect. 
My parents divorced when I was eighteen months old, and 
my dad raised me as a single father. He wasn’t exactly the soft,

he hard-wired me for achievement. 
Thanks to Dad, wake-up calls were at six o’clock every 
morning. Not by a loving tap on the shoulder or even the 

sound of a radio alarm. No, I was awakened each morning 

by the repetitious pile-driving sound of iron pounding on the 

concr oor of our garage, situated next to my bedroom. 

It was like waking up twelve feet from a construction zone. 

He’d painted a huge “No pain, no gain” sign on the wall of the 

garage, which he stared at while he did countless old-school 

strongman dead lifts, power cleans, lunges, and squats. Rain, 

sleet, or shine, Dad was out there in his shorts and tattered 

sweatshirt. He never missed a day. You could set your watch 

by his routine. 
I had more chores than a housekeeper and gardener put 
together. Upon returning from school, there was always a list 

of instructions to greet me: pull weeds, rake leaves, sweep the 

garage, dust, vacuum, do the dishes—you name it. And getting 

behind in school wasn’t tolerated. That’s just the way it was. 
Dad was the original “no excuses” guy. We weren’t ever 
allowed to stay home from school sick, unless we were actually 

puking, bleeding, or “showing bone.” The term “showing bone” 

came from his coaching days; his players knew they weren’t 

allowed to come out of the game unless they were seriously 

injured. One time his quarterback asked to be pulled out of 

the game. Dad said, “Not unless you’re showing bone.” The 

quarterback pulled back his shoulder pads, and sure enough, 

his collarbone was showing. Only then was he allowed to come 

of eld.

4/21/10   1:38:13 PM7THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
One of Dad’s core philosophies was, “It doesn’t matter how 
smart you are or aren’t, you need to make up in hard work what 

you lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability. If your 

competitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you just 

need to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!” 

No matter what the challenge, he taught me to make up in hard 

work for wherever I might be disadvantaged. Miss free throws at 

the game? Do one thousand free throws every day for a month. 

Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right hand 

behind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in your 

math? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summer 

until you get it. No excuses. If you aren’t good at something, work 

harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too. Dad went from 

being a football coach to a top salesperson. From there he became 

the boss, and ultimately, went on to own his own company. 
But I wasn’t given loads of instruction. From the beginning, 
 gure it out. He was all about taking personal 

responsibility. He didn’t hammer on us every night about 

homework; we just had to show up with the results. And, when 

you did, you were celebrated. If we got good grades, Dad took 

us to Prings, an ice cream parlor where you could get these 

king banana splits—six scoops of ice cr xings! 

Many times my siblings didn’t fare as well in school, so they 

didn’t get to go. Getting to go was a big deal, so you worked 

your butt off to win the trip. 
Dad’s discipline served as an example for me. Dad was my 
idol, and I wanted him to be proud of me. I also lived in fear 

of disappointing him. One of his philosophies is, “Be the guy 

who says ‘no.’ It’s no great achievement to go along with the

Chapter_1.indd   74/21/10   1:38:14 PM

4/21/10   1:38:14 PM8THE COMPOUND EFFECTcrowd. Be the unusual guy, the extraordinary guy.” That’s why 

I never did drugs—he never harped on me about it, but I didn’t 

want to be that guy who just went along because everyone 

else was doing it. And I didn’t want to let Dad down. 
Thanks to Dad, by age 12, I’d mastered a schedule worthy of 
the most ef cient CEO. Sometimes I griped and moaned (I was 

a kid!), but even then I secretly liked knowing that I had an edge 

over my classmates. Dad gave me a serious head start on the 
discipline and mentality it takes to be dedicated and responsible, 

to achieve whatever I set out to achieve. (It’s no accident that the 
tagline of SUCCESS magazine is “What Achievers Read.”) Today Dad and I joke about what an addictive overachiever he 
trained me to be.  gure income 

in my own business. By age twenty, I owned my own home in 

an upscale neighborhood. By age twenty-four, my income grew 

to more than $1 million a year, and by age twenty-seven, I was 

of cially a self-made millionaire with a business that brought 

in more than $50 million in revenue. That just about brings us 

to the present day, because I’m not yet forty, but I have enough 

money and assets to last my family the rest of my life. 
“There are lots of ways to screw up a kid,” Dad says. “At least my 
way was a pretty good one! You seemed to have done pretty well.” 
So, while I admit that I’ve had to practice sitting on my hands and 
being present in the moment, or chilling out peacefully in a beach 

chair from time to time (without taking a pile of business books or 

self-improvement CDs with me), I’m grateful for the success skills I 

learned from my dad, and my other mentors along the way. 
The Compound Effect reveals the “secret” behind my success. 
I’m a true believer in the Compound Effect because Dad made

sure that I lived it, each and every day, until I couldn’t live any 

other way if I tried. But if you’re like most people, you’re not a true believer. There 
are lots of perfectly understandable reasons why. You haven’t 

had the same coaching and example showing you what to do. 
You haven’t experienced the payoff of the Compound Effect. 

As a society, we have been deceived. We’ve been hypnotized by 

commercial marketing, which convinces you of problems you 

 xes to “cure” them. 

We’ve been socialized to believe in the fairy-tale endings found 

in movies and novels. We’ve lost sight of the good, old-fashioned 

value of hard and consistent work. 
Let’s examine these hurdles one by one. 
You Haven’t Experienced the Payoff 

of the Compound Effect The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards 
from a series of small, smart choices. What’s most interesting about 

this process to me is that, even though the results are massive, 

the steps, in the moment, don’t feel cant. Whether you’re 
using this strategy for improving your health, relationships, 

 nances, or anything else for that matter, the changes are so 

subtle, they’re almost imperceptible. These small changes offer 

little or no immediate result, no big win, no obvious I-told-you-

so payoff. So why bother? 
Most people get tripped up by the simplicity of the Compound 
Effect. For instance, they quit after the eighth day of running 

because they’re still overweight. Or, they stop practicing the 
Chapter_1.indd   9

Chapter_1.indd   94/21/10   12:58:16 PM

4/21/10   12:58:16 PM10THE COMPOUND EFFECTpiano after six months because they haven’t mastered anything 

other than “Chopsticks.” Or, they stop making contributions to 

their IRA after a few years because they could use the cash—

and it doesn’t seem to be adding up to much anyway. 
What they don’t realize is that these small, seemingly 
 cant steps completed consistently over time will create a 

radical difference. Let me give you a few detailed examples. 
Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE
 The Magic Penny 
If you were given a choice between taking $3 million in cash 
this very instant and a single penny that doubles in value every 
day for 31 days, which would you choose? If you’ve heard this 

before, you know the penny gambit is the choice you should 

make—you know it’s the course that will lead to greater wealth. 

Yet why is it so hard to believe choosing the penny will result in 

more money in the end? 
Because it takes so much longer to see the payoff. Let’s take a closer look. Let’s say you take the cold, hard cash and your friend goes the 
penny route. On Day Five, your friend has sixteen cents. You, 

however, have $3 million. On Day Ten, it’s $5.12 versus your 

big bucks. How do you think your friend is feeling about her 
decision? You’re spending your millions, enjoying the heck out 

of it, and loving your choice. After 20 full days, with only 11 days left, Penny Lane has 
only $5,243. How is she feeling about herself at this point? For 
 ce and positive behavior, she has barely more than 
Chapter_1.indd   10

Chapter_1.indd   104/21/10   12:58:18 PM

4/21/10   12:58:18 PM11THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
$5,000. You, however, have $3 million. Then the invisible magic 

of the Compound Effect starts to become visible. The same 

small mathematical growth improvement each day makes the 

compounded penny worth $10,737,418.24 on Day Thirty-one, 
more than three times your $3 million. 
In this example we see why consistency over time is so important. On Day Twenty-nine, you’ve got your $3 million; 

Penny Lane has around $2.7 million. It isn’t until Day Thirty 

of this 31-day race that she pulls ahead, with $5.3 million. And 

it isn’t until the very last day of this monthlong ultramarathon that your friend blows you out of the water; she ends up with 
$10,737,418.24 to your $3 million. Very few things are as impressive as the “magic” of compounding 
pennies. Amazingly, this “force” is equally powerful in every area 

of your life. 
Here’s another example… 
Three Friends Let’s take three buddies who all grew up together. They live in 
the same neighborhood, with very similar sensibilities. Each makes 

around $50,000 a year. They’re all married and have average health 

and body weight, plus a little bit of that dr ab.” 
Friend number one, let’s call him Larry, plods along doing as 
he’s always done. He’s happy, or so he thinks, but complains 

occasionally that nothing ever changes. Friend number two, Scott, starts making some small, 
seemingly inconsequential, positive changes. He begins 

reading 10 pages of a good book per day and listening to 
Chapter_1.indd   11

Chapter_1.indd   114/21/10   12:58:19 PM

4/21/10   12:58:19 PM12THE COMPOUND EFFECT30 minutes of something instructional or inspirational on 

his commute to work. Scott wants to see changes in his life, 

but doesn’t want to make a fuss over it. He recently read an 

interview with Dr. Mehmet Oz in 
SUCCESS magazine and 
chose one idea from the article to implement in his life: He’s 

going to cut 125 calories from his diet every day. No big deal. 

We’re talking maybe a cup of cereal less, trading that can of 

soda for a bottle of seltzer, switching from mayo to mustard 

on his sandwich. Doable. He’s also started walking a couple 

thousand extra steps per day (less than a mile). No grand 

acts of bravery or effort. Stuff anyone could do. But Scott is 

determined to stick with these choices, knowing that even 

though they’re simple, he could also easily be tempted to 

abandon them. 
Friend number three, Brad, makes a few poor choices. He 
recently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more of 

his favorite programs. He’s been trying out the recipes he’s 

seen on the Food Channel—the cheesy casseroles and desserts 

are his favorites. Oh, and he installed a bar in his family room 

and added one alcoholic drink per week to his diet. Nothing 

crazy; Brad just wants to have a little more fun. 
 ve months, no perceivable differences exist 
among Larry, Scott, or Brad. Scott continues to read a little bit 

every night and listen to audios during his commute; Brad is 
“enjoying” life and doing less. Larry keeps doing as he always 
has. Even though each man has his own pattern of behavior ve 

months isn’t long enough to see any real decline or improvement 

in their situations. In fact, if you charted the three men’s weights, 

you’d see a rounding error of zero. They’d look exactly equal.

4/21/10   12:58:22 PM13THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
At the end of ten months, we still can’t see noticeable changes 
in any of their lives. It’s not until we get to the end of the 

eighteenth month that the slightest differences are measurable 

in these three friends’ appearances. 
 ve, we start seeing really 
measurable, visible differences. At month twenty-seven, we see 

an expansive difference. And, by month thirty-one, the change is 

startling. Brad is now fat while Scott is trim. By simply cutting 

125 calories a day, in thirty-one months, Scott has lost thirty-

three pounds! 
31 months = 940 days
940 days x 125 calories/day = 117,500 calories saved 
117,500 calories saved x 1 pound/3,500 calories = 33.5 pounds! Brad ate only 125 more calories more a day in that same 
time frame, and gained 33.5 pounds. Now he weighs 

67 pounds more than Scott! But the differences are more 

significant than weight. Scott’s invested almost one thousand 

hours reading good books and listening to self-improvement 

audios; by putting his newly gained knowledge into practice, 

he’s earned a promotion and a raise. Best of all, his marriage 

is thriving. Brad? He’s unhappy at work, and his marriage is 

on the rocks. And Larry? Larry is pretty much exactly where 

he was two and half years ago, except now he’s a little more 

bitter about it. 
The phenomenal power of the Compound Effect is that 
simple. The difference between people who employ the

4/21/10   12:58:24 PM14THE COMPOUND EFFECTCompound Ef t compared to their peers 

who allow the same effect to work against them is almost 

inconceivable. It looks miraculous! Like magic or quantum 

leaps. After thirty-one months (or thirty-one years), the person 

who uses the positive nature of the Compound Effect appears 

to be an “overnight success.” In reality, his or her profound 

success was the result of small, smart choices, completed 

consistently over time. 
The Ripple Effect The results in the above example seem dramatic, I know. But 
it goes even deeper than that. The reality is that even one small 

 cant impact that causes an unexpected 

and unintended ripple effect. Let’s put one of Brad’s bad habits 

under the microscope—eating rich food more frequently—to 

better understand how the Compound Effect can also work in 

a negative way and can create a ripple effect that impacts your 

entire life. 
Brad makes some muf ns from a recipe he learned from the 
Food Channel. He’s proud and his family loves it, and it seems to 

add value all around. He starts making them (and other sweets) 

frequently. He loves his own cooking and eats more than his 

share—but not so much that anyone notices. However, the extra 

food makes Brad sluggish at night. He wakes up a little groggy, 

which makes him cranky. The crankiness and sleep-deprivation 

begin to impact his work performance. He’s less productive, and 

as a result, gets discouraging feedback from his boss. By the end 

of the day ed with his job and his energy level is

Chapter_1.indd   144/21/10   12:58:26 PM

way down. The commute home seems longer and more stressful 

than ever. All of this makes him reach for more comfort food—

stress has a way of doing that. 
The overall lack of energy makes Brad less likely to take walks 
with his wife, like he used to. He just doesn’t feel like it. She 
misses their time together and takes his withdrawal personally. 

With fewer shared activities with his wife and an absence of 

fresh air and exercise, Brad’s not getting the endorphin release 

that had helped make him feel upbeat and enthusiastic. Because 
he’s not as happy nding fault with himself and others, 

and stops complimenting his wife. As his own body starts to feel 

 abby, he feels less  dent, less attractive and becomes 

less romantic. 
Brad doesn’t realize how his lack of energy and affection toward 
his wife affects her. He just knows that he feels funky. He starts losing 

himself in late-night TV because it’s easy and distracting. Feeling his 

distance, Brad’s wife starts to complain, then becomes needy. When 

that doesn’t work, she emotionally withdraws to protect herself. 

She’s lonely. She pours her energy into her work and spends more 

 ll her need for companionship. Men 

 irting with her, which makes her feel desirable again. She 

would never cheat on Brad, but he has a feeling something’s wrong. 

Instead of seeing that his poor choices and behaviors are at the root 
of their pr nds fault with his wife. 
Believing that the other person is wrong rather than looking 
inside and doing the work necessary to clean up your mess is 

basic Psychology 101 stuff. In Brad’s case, he doesn’t know to look 

inside—they don’t offer self-improvement or relationship advice 

on Top Chef
 or his favorite crime shows. However, the thought may

books his buddy Scott read, he might have learned about ways to 

change negative habits. Unfortunately for Brad, the small choices 

he made on a daily basis created a ripple that wreaked havoc on 

every area of his life. 
Of course, all that calorie-counting and intellectual stimulation 
has had the opposite effect with Scott, who’s now reaping the 

bounty of positive results. It’s that simple. With enough time 

and consistency, the outcomes become visible. Better yet, they’re 

totally predictable.

The beauty of the Compound Effect is in its simplicity. Notice how, 
on the left side of the diagram, the results are intangible, but how 

powerfully they differ later on. The behaviors all along the way are 

exactly the same, but the magic of the Compound Effect eventually 

kicks in to bring massive differences in results.

4/22/10   4:07:19 PM17THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION
The Compound Effect is predictable and measurable—
that’s great news! Isn’t it comforting to know you only need to 

take a series of tiny steps, consistently, over time, to radically 

improve your life? Doesn’t that sound easier than mustering 

up some grand show of bravery and heroic strength, only 

to wear yourself out and have to drum up all that energy 

again at a later date for another try (which will likely be 

unsuccessful)? I’m exhausted just thinking about it. But that’s 

what people do. We’ve been conditioned by society to believe 

in the effectiveness of a great display of massive effort. Heck, 

it’s downright all-American! See Figure 1.
Success, Old School 
The most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that we 
have to keep working away for a while, consistently and ef ciently, 

before we can begin to see the payoff. Our grandparents knew this, 

though they didn’t spend their evenings glued to the TV watching 

infomercials about how to have thin thighs in thirty days or a real 

estate kingdom in six months. I bet your grandparents worked 

six days a week, from sunup to sundown, using the skills they 

learned in their youth and repeatedly throughout their entire life. 

They knew the secret was hard work, discipline, and good habits. 
It’s interesting that wealth tends to skip a generation. 
Overwhelming abundance often leads to a lackadaisical 

mentality, which brings about a sedentary lifestyle. Children of 

the wealthy are especially susceptible. They weren’t the ones 

who developed the discipline and character to create the wealth 

 rst place, so it makes sense that they may not have the 
Chapter_1.indd   17

Chapter_1.indd   174/21/10   12:58:32 PM

4/21/10   12:58:32 PM18THE COMPOUND EFFECTsame sense of value for wealth or understand what’s necessary 

to keep it. We frequently see this entitlement mentality in 

children of royalty, movie stars, and corporate executives—

and to a lesser degree, in children and adults everywhere. 
As a nation, our entire populace seems to have lost 
appreciation for the value of a strong work ethic. We’ve had two, 

if not three, generations of Americans who have known great 

prosperity, wealth, and ease. Our expectations of what it really 

takes to create lasting success—things like grit, hard work, and 

fortitude—aren’t alluring, and thus have been mostly forgotten. 

We’ve lost respect for the strife and struggle of our forefathers. 

The massive effort they put forth instilled discipline, chiseled 

their character, and stoked the spirit to brave new frontiers. 
The truth is, complacency has impacted all great empires, 
including, but not limited to, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Spanish, 

Portuguese, French, and English. Why? Because nothing fails like 

success. Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason. 

People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable. 
Having experienced extended periods of prosperity, health, and 
wealth, we become complacent. We stop doing what we did to get 

us there. We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn’t 

jump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental and 

insidious that he doesn’t notice he’s getting cooked! 
If we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents’ 
work ethic. It’s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of saving 
America, at least for your own greater success and achievement. 

Don’t buy into the genie in a lamp idea. You can sit on your couch

 re, channel that 2,000-year-old guru, or chant af rmations 

if you want to, but much of that is hocus-pocus commercialism 

manipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses. Real and 
lasting success requires work—and lots of it! 
I have a quick, real-time story to illustrate this nothing-fails-like 
success concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my home 

on the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was always 

immaculate, the hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone, 

the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it), 

and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eat 

there and would often wait more than an hour to be seated. 
Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take its 
success for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staff 

disheveled and curt, and the food quality hit-or-miss. The place 

was out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing what 

made them successful to begin with. Their success clouded their 

perspective and they slacked off. 
Microwave Mentality Understanding the Compound Effect will rid you of “insta-
results” expectation—the belief success should be as fast as 

your fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photo 
processing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, your 

instant hot water and text messaging. Enough, okay? Promise yourself that you’re going to let go once and for all of your 
lottery-winner expectations because, let’s face it, you only hear stories 

about the one winner, not the millions of losers. That person you see

4/21/10   12:58:36 PM20THE COMPOUND EFFECTjumping up and down in front of the Vegas slot machine or at the 

Santa Anita horse track doesn’t reveal the hundreds of times that same 

person lost. If we go back to our mathematical chance of a positive 

result, again, we have a rounding error of zero—as in, you have about 

zero
 chance of winning. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, author 

of Stumbling on Happiness, says that if we gave lottery losers each thirty 
seconds on TV to announce not, “I won!” but “I lost,” it would take 

almost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing! 
When you understand how the Compound Effect works, you 
 xes or silver bullets. Don’t try to fool yourself 

into believing that a mega-successful athlete didn’t live through 

regular bone-crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice. He 

got up early to practice—and kept practicing long after all others 

had stopped. He faced the sheer agony and frustration of the failure, 

loneliness, hard work, and disappointment it took to become No. 1. 
By the end of this book, or even before, I want you to know in 
your bones that your only path to success is through a continuum 

of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes dif cult daily 

disciplines compounded over time. Know, too, that the results, the 

life, and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours when you put 

the Compound Effect to work for you. If you use the principles 

outlined in The Compound Effect, you will create your fairy tale 
ending! See Figure 2.
