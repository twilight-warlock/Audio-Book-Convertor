CHAPTER 2 CHOICES
We all come into this world the same: naked, scared, andignorant. After that grand entrance, the life we end up with issimply an accumulation of all the choices we make. Our choicescan be our best friend or our worst enemy. They can deliver us toour goals or send us orbiting into a galaxy far, far away.Think about it. Everything in your life exists because yourst made achoice about something. Choices are at the root ofevery one of your results. Each choice starts a behavior thatover time becomes a habit. Choose poorly, and you just mightnd yourself back at the drawing board, forced to make new,often harder choices. Don’t choose at all, and you’ve made thechoice to be the passive receiver of whatever comes your way.In essence, you make your choices, and then your choices makeyou. Every decision, no matter how slight, alters the trajectory ofyour life—whether or not to go to college, who to marry, to have thatChapter_2.indd   23Chapter_2.indd   234/21/10   12:58:50 PM
one more prospecting call or call it a day, to say I love you or not.Every choice has an impact on the Compound Effect of your life.This chapter is about becoming aware of and making choicesthat support the expansion of your life. Sounds complicated, butyou’ll be amazed by its simplicity. No longer will 99 percent ofyour choices be unconscious. No more will most of your dailyroutines and traditions come as a reaction to your programming.You’ll ask yourself (and be able to answer), “How many of mybehaviors have I not ‘voted on’? What am I doing that I didn’tconsciously choose to do, yet continue to do every day?” By employing the same idiot-proof strategies I’ve used tocatapult my own life and career, strengthened by the CompoundEffect, you’ll be able to loosen the mysterious grip of the things thatare unwinding your life and pulling you in the wrong direction.You’ll be able to hit the Pause button before stumbling into idiotterritory. You’ll experience the ease of making decisions that leadto behaviors and habits that support you, every time.Your biggest challenge isn’t that you’ve intentionally beenx. Your biggestchallenge is that you’ve been sleepwalking through your choices.Half the time, you’re not even aware you’re making them! Ourchoices are often shaped by our culture and upbringing. They canbe so entwined in our routine behaviors and habits that they seembeyond our control. For instance, have you ever been going aboutyour business, enjoying your life, when all of sudden you made astupid choice or series of small choices that ultimately sabotagedyour hard work and momentum, all for no apparent reason?You didn’t intend to sabotage yourself, but bynot thinking aboutChapter_2.indd   24Chapter_2.indd   244/21/10   12:58:52 PM4/21/10   12:58:52 PM25CHOICESyour decisions—weighing the risks and potential outcomes—youfound yourself facing unintended consequences. Nobody intends to become obese, go through bankruptcy, or get a divorce, butoften (if not always) those consequences are the result of a seriesof small, poor choices.Elephants Don’t Bite Have you ever been bitten by an elephant? How about a mosquito? It’s the little things in life that will bite you.Occasionally, we see big mistakes threaten to destroy a career orreputation in an instant—the famous comedian who rants racialslurs during a stand-up routine, the drunken anti-Semitic anticsof a once-celebrated humanitarian, the anti-gay-rights senatorcaught soliciting gay sex in a restroom, the admired femaletennis player who uncharacteristically threatens an of cial witha tirade of expletives. Clearly, these types of poor choices havemajor repercussions. But even if you’ve pulled such a whopperin your past, it’s not extraordinary massive steps backward orthe tragic single moments that we’re concerned with here.For most of us, it’s the frequent, small, and seeminglyinconsequential choices that are of grave concern. I’m talkingabout the decisions you think don’t make any difference at all.It’s the little things that inevitably and predictably derail yoursuccess. Whether they’re bone-headed maneuvers, no-biggiebehaviors, or are disguised as positive choices (those are especiallycant decisions can completelythrow you off course because you’re not mindful of them. You getoverwhelmed, space out, and become unaware of the little actionsChapter_2.indd   25Chapter_2.indd   254/21/10   12:58:55 PM
right. It always works, remember? But in this case it works againstyou because you’re doing… you’re sleepwalking.For instance, you inhale a soda and bag of potato chips and suddenly realize only after you polished off the last chip thatyou blew an entire day of healthy eating—and you weren’teven hungry. You get caught up and lose two hours watchingmindless TV—scratch that, let’s give you some credit and makeit an educational documentary—before realizing you spaced onpreparing for an important presentation to land a valuable client.You blurt out a knee-jerk lie to a loved one for no good reason,when the tr ne. What’s going on?You’ve allowed yourself to make a choice without thinking.And as long as you’re making choices unconsciously, you can’tconsciously choose to change that ineffective behavior andturn it into productive habits. It’s time to WAKE UP and makeempowering choices.Thanksgiving Year-Roundngers at others, isn’t it? “I’m not gettingahead because of my lame boss.” “I would have gotten thatpromotion if it hadn’t been for that backstabbing co-worker.” “I’malways in a bad mood because my kids are driving me crazy.”And we’r nger-pointing departmentwhen it comes to our romantic relationships—you know, wherethe other person is the one who needs to change. A few years back, a friend of mine was complaining about hiswife. Fr c lady, and he wasChapter_2.indd   26Chapter_2.indd   264/21/10   12:58:57 PM4/21/10   12:58:57 PM27CHOICESlucky to have her. I told him as much, but he continued to point outall the ways she was responsible for his unhappiness. That’s whenI shared an experience that had literally changed my marriage.One Thanksgiving, I decided to keep a Thanks Giving journal formy wife. Every day for an entire year I logged at least one thingI appreciated about her—the way she interacted with her friends,how she cared for our dogs, the fresh bed she prepared, a succulentmeal she whipped up, or the beautiful way she styled her hair thatday—whatever. I looked for the things my wife was doing thattouched me, or revealed attributes, characteristics, or qualities Iappreciated. I wrote them all down secretly for the entire year. Bythe end of that year lled an entire journal.When I gave it to her the following Thanksgiving, shecried, calling it the best gift she’d ever received. (Even betterthan the BMW I’d given her for her birthday!) The funnything was that the person most affected by this gift was me.All that journaling forced me to focus on my wife’s positiveaspects. I was consciously looking for all the things she wasdoing “right.” That heartfelt focus overwhelmed anything Imight have otherwise complained about. I fell deeply in lovewith her all over again (maybe even more than ever, as I wasseeing subtleties in her nature and behavior instead of her moreobvious qualities). My appreciation, gratitude, and intention tond the best in her was something I held in my heart and eyeseach day. This caused me to show up differently in my marriage,which, of course, made her respond differently to me. Soon, Ihad even more things to write in my Thanks Giving journal! Asa result of choosing to take a mer ve minutes every day orso to document all the reasons why I was grateful for her, weChapter_2.indd   27Chapter_2.indd   274/21/10   12:59:00 PM4/21/10   12:59:00 PM28THECOMPOUNDEFFECTexperienced one of the best years of our marriage, and it’s onlygotten better.After I shared my experience, my friend decided to keep aThanks Giving journal about his wife. W rst fewmonths, he completely turned around his marriage. Choosingto look for and focus on his wife’s positive qualities changed hisview of her, which changed how he interacted with her. As aresult, she made different choices about the way she respondedto him. The cycle perpetuated.

I was eighteen when I was introduced to theidea of personal responsibility at a seminar, and the conceptcompletely transformed my life. If you threw out the rest of thisbook and only practiced this one concept, within two to threeyears the changes in your life would be so great, your friendsand family would have dif culty remembering the “old you.”In that seminar I attended at eighteen, the speaker asked,“What percentage of shared responsibility do you have inmaking a relationship work?” I was a teenager, so wise in theways of true love. Of course I had all the answers.Chapter_2.indd   28Chapter_2.indd   284/21/10   12:59:02 PM4/21/10   12:59:02 PM29CHOICES fty!” I blurted out. It was so obvious; both peoplemust be willing to share the responsibility evenly or someone’sgetting ripped off.“Fifty-one/forty-nine,” yelled someone else, arguing thatyou’d have to be willing to do more than the other person. Aren’tr ce and generosity?“Eighty/twenty,” yelled another.The instructor turned to the easel and wrote 100/0 on the paperin big black letters. “You have to be willing to give 100 percent withzero expectation of receiving anything in return,” he said. “Onlywhen you’re willing to take 100 percent responsibility for makingthe relationship work will it work. Otherwise, a relationship leftto chance will always be vulnerable to disaster.”Whoa. This wasn’t what I was expecting! But I quickly understood how this concept could transform every area of mylife. If I always took 100 percent responsibility for everything Iexperienced—completely owning all of my choices and all theways I responded to whatever happened to me—I held the power.Everything was up to me. I was responsible for everything I did,didn’t do, or how I responded to what was done to me.I know you think you take responsibility for your life. I’ve yet toask anybody who doesn’t say, “Ofcourse, I take responsibility for mylife.” But then you look at how most people operate in the world;ther nger pointing, victimhood, blaming, and expectingsomeone else or the government to solve their problems. If you’veever blamed traf c for being late, or decided you are in a bad moodbecause of something your kid, spouse, or co-worker did, you’re nottaking 100 percent personal responsibility. You arrived late becausethe printer was busy? Maybe you shouldn’t have waited until theChapter_2.indd   29Chapter_2.indd   294/21/10   12:59:04 PM
have double-checked it yourself before delivering it? Not gettingalong with your unreasonable teen? There are a countless fantasticbooks and classes to help you learn how to deal.You alone are responsible for what youdo, don’t do, or how you respondto what’s done to you. This empowering mindset revolutionized my life. Luck, circumstances, or the right situationwasn’t what mattered. Ifit was to be, it was up to me. I was fr y. No matter who was elected president, how badlythe economy tanked, or what anybody said, did, or didn’t do,I was still 100 percent in control ofme. Through choosing to beof cially liberated from past, present, and future victimhood, I’dhit the jackpot. I had the unlimited power to control my destiny.Getting Lucky Maybe you believe you’re simply unlucky. But really, that’sjust another excuse. The difference between becoming fabulouslyrich, happy, and healthy, or broke, depressed, and unhealthy, isthe choices you make throughout life. Nothing else will make thedifference. Here’s the thing about luck: We’re all lucky. If you are onthe right side of the dirt, have your health, and a little food in yourcupboard, you are incredibly lucky. Everyone has the opportunityto be “lucky,” because beyond having the basics of health andsustenance, luck simply comes down to a series of choices.When I asked Richard Branson if he felt luck played a part inhis success, he answered, “Yes, of course, we are all lucky. If youlive in a free society, you are lucky. Luck surrounds us every day;we are constantly having lucky things happen to us, whether youChapter_2.indd   30Chapter_2.indd   304/21/10   12:59:07 PM4/21/10   12:59:07 PM31CHOICESrecognize it or not. I have not been any more lucky or unluckythan anyone else. The difference is when luck came my way, I tookadvantage of it.”Ah, spoken like a man knighted with wisdom. While we’re onthe topic, it’s my belief that the old adage we often hear—“Luckis when opportunity meets preparation”—isn’t enough. I believethere are two other critical components to “luck.”The (Complete) Formula for Getting Lucky:  Preparation (personal growth)+ Attitude (belief/mindset) + Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) + Action (doing something about it) =Luck Preparation: By consistently improving and preparing yourself—your skills, knowledge, expertise, relationships, and resources—youhave the wherewithal to take advantage of great opportunitieswhen they arise (when luck “strikes”). Then, you can be like ArnoldPalmer, who toldSUCCESS magazine in February of 2009, “It’s afunny thing; the more I practice, the luckier I get.”Attitude: This is where luck evades most people, and whereSir Richard is spot-on with his belief that luck is all around us.It’s simply a matter of seeing situations, conversations, andcircumstances as fortuitous. You cannot see what you don’t lookfor, and you cannot look for what you don’t believe in.Opportunity: It’s possible to make your own luck, but theluck I’m talking about here isn’t planned for, or it comes faster ordifferently than expected. In this stage of the formula, luck isn’tChapter_2.indd   31Chapter_2.indd   314/21/10   12:59:09 PM
of its own accord.Action: This is where you come in. However this luck wasdelivered to you—from the universe, God, the Lucky Charmsleprechaun, or whomever or whatever you associate deliveringyour good fortune—it’s now your job to act on it. This is whatseparates the Richard Bransons from the Joseph Wallingtons.Joseph who? Exactly. You’ve never heard of him. That’s because hefailed to take action on all the lucky things that happened to him.So no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the greatdefeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. Countlesspeople have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you,and yet they’re wealthier and mor lled. Luck is an equal-opportunity distributor. Lady luck shines on all, but rather thanhaving your umbrella drawn, you’ve got  to have your face tothe sky. When it comes down to it, it’s all you, baby. There’s noother way around it.The High Price of Tuition at UHK(University of Hard Knocks) Nearly a decade ago I was asked to be a partner in a new startupventure. I invested a considerable sum of money into the deal andworked tirelessly on it for nearly two years befor nding out thatmy partner had mismanaged and squandered all the cash. I lostmore than $330,000. I didn’t try to sue him; in fact, I lent him moremoney later for a personal situation. The bottom line was the losswas my fault. I had agreed to be his partner without doing enoughdue diligence on his background and personal character. DuringChapter_2.indd   32Chapter_2.indd   324/21/10   12:59:11 PM4/21/10   12:59:11 PM33CHOICESour time in business, I wasn’t inspecting what I was expecting. Icould justify it by saying I trusted him, but the truth was I wasnances more diligently.Not only had I made the choice to start this relationship andbusiness, but I’d also made many choices to ignore obvious redags and warning signs. Because I chose to not be completelyresponsible for the business, in the end, I was responsible for theresults. When I learned of the wrongdoings, I chose not to lose anymor ghting it. Instead, I licked my wounds, learned mylesson, and moved on. In hindsight, I’d make the same choice topick up and move on again today.I now challenge you to do the same. No matter what has happened to you, take complete responsibility for it—good orbad, victory or defeat. Own it. My mentor Jim Rohn said, “Theday you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day youtake full responsibility for your life.”Today is graduation day! From this day forward, choose tobe 100 percent responsible for your life. Eliminate all of yourexcuses. Embrace the fact that you are freed by your choices, aslong as you assume personal responsibility for them.It’s time to make the choice to take control.Your Secret Weapon—Your ScorecardI’m about to walk you through one of the single greatest strategiesI’ve ever used in my personal development. This strategy helpsme take control of the choices I make throughout the day, causingeverything else to fall into place, and leading to behaviors and actionsthat shepherd my habits into line like dutiful, loyal minions.Chapter_2.indd   33Chapter_2.indd   334/21/10   12:59:14 PMwant to be successful.

Now picture where youwant to be: richer, thinner, happier rst steptoward change is awareness. If you want to get from where youare to where you want to be, you have to start by becoming awareof the choices that lead you away from your desired destination.Become very conscious of every choice you make today so youcan begin to make smarter choices moving forward.To help you become aware of your choices, I want you totrackevery action that relates to the area of your life you want to improve.If you’ve decided you want get out of debt, you’re going to trackevery penny you pull from your pocket. If you’ve decided you wantto lose weight, you’re going to track everything you put into yourmouth. If you’ve decided to train for an athletic event, you’re goingto track every step you take, every workout you do. Simply carryaround a small notebook, something you’ll keep in your pocket orpurse at all times, and a writing instrument. You’re going to write itall down. Every day. Without fail. No excuses, no exceptions. As ifBig Brother’s watching you. As if my dad and I will come and makeyou do a hundred pushups every time you miss.Doesn’t sound like much, I know—writing things down on alittle piece of paper. But trackingmy progress and missteps is theone of the reasons I’ve accumulated the success I have. The processforces you to be conscious of your decisions. But as Jim Rohn wouldsay, “What’s simple to do is also simple not to do.” The magic is notin the complexity of the task; the magic is in the doing of simpleChapter_2.indd   34Chapter_2.indd   344/21/10   12:59:16 PM4/21/10   12:59:16 PM35CHOICESthings repeatedly and long enough to ignite the miracle of theCompound Effect. So, beware of neglecting the simple things thatmake the big things in your life possible. The biggest differencebetween successful people and unsuccessful people is thatsuccessful people are willing to do what unsuccessful people arenot. Remember that; it will come in handy many times throughoutlife when faced with a dif cult, tedious, or tough choice.Money TrapI learned the power of tracking the hard way, after I’d actednances. Back in my early twenties,when I was making a lot of money selling real estate, I met withmy accountant.“You owe well over $100,000 in taxes,” he said.“What?!” I said. “I don’t have that kind of cash justlying around.”“Why not?” he asked. “You collected several times that; certainlyyou set aside the taxes that would be due on that money.”“Evidently I didn’t,” I said.“Where did the money go?” he asked.“I don’t know,” I said, a sobering confession, for sure. Themoney had passed through my hands like water, and I hadn’teven noticed! Then my accountant did me a great favor.“Son,” he said, looking me dead in the eyes, “you’ve got to get agrip. I’ve seen this a hundred times before. You’re spending moneylike a drunken fool, and you don’t even know how to account forit. That’s stupid. Stop it. You are now seriously in the hole. YouChapter_2.indd   35Chapter_2.indd   354/21/10   12:59:18 PM
to pay for your back taxes. Continue this, and you’ll dig yournancial grave with your own wallet.”I immediately got the message.Here’s what my accountant had me do: carry a small notepadin my back pocket, and write down every single cent I spent forthirty days. Whether it was a thousand dollars for a new suit orfty cents for air to  ll up my tires, it all had to go down on thenotepad. Wow. This brought an instantaneous awareness of themany unconscious choices I was making that resulted in moneypouring out of my pockets. Because I had to log everything, Iresisted buying some things, just so I didn’t have to take out thenotepad and write it in the dang book! Keeping a money log for thirty days straight cemented a new awareness in me, and created a completely new set of choicesand disciplines around my spending. And, since awarenessand positive behaviors compound, I found myself beingmore proactive with money in general, putting away more forretir nding areas to save where there was clear waste,and enjoying the fun quotient of money—“play money”—all themore. When I did consider shelling out for entertainment, I did soonly after a long pause. This tracking exercise changed my awareness of how Irelated to my money. It worked so well, in fact, that I’ve usedit many times to change other behaviors. Tracking is my go-totransformation model for everything that ails me. Over the yearsI’ve tracked what I eat and drink, how much I exercise, howmuch time I spend improving a skill, my number of sales calls,even the improvement of my relationships with family, friends,Chapter_2.indd   36Chapter_2.indd   364/21/10   12:59:21 PM4/21/10   12:59:21 PM37CHOICESor my spouse. The results have been no less profound than mymoney-tracking wake-up call. In buying this book, you’re basically paying me for my opinion,my guidance. This is where I’m going to become a hard-ass andinsist you track your behaviors for at least one whole week. Thisbook isn’t designed to entertain you; it is designed to help youget results. To get results, you have to take some action.You may have heard about tracking before. In fact, you’veprobably done your own version of this exercise. But I also betyou aren’t doing it now, right? How do I know?Because your lifeisn’t working as successfully as you’d like.You’ve gotten derailed.Tracking is the way to get it back on track.Do you know how the casinos make so much money in Vegas?Because they track every table, every winner, every hour. Why doOlympic trainers get paid top dollar? Because they track everyworkout, every calorie, and every micronutrient for their athletes.All winners are trackers. Right now I want you to track your lifewith the same intention: to bring your goals within sight. Tracking is a simple exercise. It works because it bringsmoment-to-moment awareness to the actions you take in thearea of your life you want to improve. You’ll be surprised atwhat you will observe about your behavior. You cannot manageor improve something until you measure it. Likewise, you can’tmake the most of who you are—your talents and resources andcapabilities—until you are aware of and accountable for youractions. Every professional athlete and his or her coach trackeach performance down to the smallest minutiae. Pitchers knowtheir stats on every pitch in their repertoire. Golfers have evenmore metrics on their swings. Professional athletes know how toChapter_2.indd   37Chapter_2.indd   374/21/10   12:59:23 PMpay attention to what they record and make changes accordingly, 
because they know when their stats improve they win moregames and earn more in endorsement deals.At any given moment, I want you to know exactly how well you’re doing. I’m asking you to track yourself as if you’re avaluable commodity. Because you are. Want that idiot-proofsystem we talked about earlier? This is it. So, regardless ofwhether you think you’re aware of your habits or not (believeme, you’re not!), I’m asking you to start tracking. Doing so willrevolutionize your life, and ultimately, your lifestyle.Keep It Slow and Easy Don’t panic. We’re starting off with an easy, breezy tempo. Justtrack one habit for one week. Pick the habit that has the greatestcontrol over you; that’s where you’ll start. Once you beginreaping the rewards of the Compound Effect, you’ll naturallywant to introduce this practice into other areas of your life. Inother words, you’llchoose to choose tracking. Let’s say the category you choose is getting your eating under control because you want to lose weight. Your task is towrite down everything you put in your mouth, from the steak,potatoes, and salad you have at dinner, to those many tiny choicesduring the day—that handful of pretzels in the break room, thatsecond slice of cheese on your sandwich, that “fun-sized” candybar, that sample at Costco, those extra sips of wine after the hosttops off your glass. Don’t forget the beverages. They all add up,but unless tracked, they’re easy to dismiss or forget because theyChapter_2.indd   38Chapter_2.indd   384/21/10   12:59:25 PM4/21/10   12:59:25 PM39CHOICESseem so small. Again, merely writing these things down soundssimple—and it is—BUT ONLY WHEN YOU DO IT. That’s whyI’m asking that you commit to choosing a category and a startdate, now,before you turn this page. I am going to start tracking _______________ on ____________.[date/month/year]What will the tracking look like? It will be thorough,as in organized. And relentless, as in constant. Each dayyou’ll start with the date at the top of a fresh page, and startkeeping track.rst week of tracking? You’ll probablybe in shock. You’ll be astonished at how those calories, pennies,minutes have been escaping you. You never even knew that theywere there, let alone that they’d vanished.Now, keep going. You’re going to track in this one area forthreeweeks. Maybe you’re already groaning; you just don’t want to doit. But trust me: You’ll be so blown away by the results after oneweek you’ll sign yourself up for another two. I can practicallyguarantee it.Why three weeks? You’ve heard psychologists say thatsomething doesn’t become a habit until you practice it for threeweeks. It’s not an exact science, but it’s a good benchmark,and it has worked for me. So, ideally, I want you to stick withyour choice to track your behaviors for twenty-one days. Ifyou refuse, I’m not going to lose anything (heck, it’s not mywaistline, cardiovascular health, bank balance, or relationshipyou’re messing with!). But, seriously, you’re reading this bookbecause you want to change your life, right? And I promisedChapter_2.indd   39Chapter_2.indd   394/21/10   12:59:28 PM
action isn’t easy, but it’s simple and doable. So do it.Promise yourself to start. Today. For the next three weeks, chooseto carry around your own small notepad (or large one, if that’smore enticing), and writeevery single thing down in your category.What happens in three weeks? You move from the shock thatrst week to the happy surprise of seeing how merelybecoming conscious of your actions begins to shape them. You’llnd yourself asking, “Do I really want that candy bar? I’m gonnahave to haul out my notebook and write it down, and I’ll feel alittle sheepish.” That’s two hundred calories saved right there. Turndown that candy bar every day, and in a little more than two weeks,you’ll have already lost a pound! You’ll start adding up that $4.00coffee on the way to work and realize,Holy cow! I’ve just spent sixtybucks on coffee in three weeks!Hey, that’s a thousand bucks a year! Or,compounded, that’s $51,833.79 in twenty years! How much do youreallyneed to stop for coffee?

Simply amazing,isn’t it?The Unsung, Unseen HeroOnce you start tracking your life, your attention will befocused on the smallest things you’re doing right, as well asthe smallest things you’re doing wrong. And when you chooseto make even the smallest course corrections consistently, overtime, you’ll begin to see amazing results. But don’t expectimmediate fanfare. When I say “small” course corrections, I’mtalking truly invisible. Chances are no one’s going to noticethem anytime soon. There will be no applause. No one’sgoing to send you a congratulations card or a trophy for thesedisciplines. And yet, eventually, their compounding effectwill result in an exceptional payoff. It’s the littlest disciplinesthat pay off over time, the effort and preparation for the greattriumph that happened when no one was looking. And yetthe results are exceptional. A horse wins by a nose, but gets10 times the prize money. Is the horse 10 times faster? No,just a little bit better. But it was those extra laps around theChapter_2.indd   42Chapter_2.indd   424/21/10   12:59:35 PM4/21/10   12:59:35 PM43CHOICEStrack, the extra discipline in the horse’s nutrition, or the extrawork by the jockey that made the results a slight bit betterwith compounded rewards.After hundreds of tournaments played and thousands ofstrokes tallied, the difference between the No. 1 ranked golferand the No. 10 golfer is an average of only 1.9 strokes, butthe differ ve times (over $10 millionve times better, noteven 50 percent or even 10 percent better.

of little things adding up. It’s not the big things that add upin the end; it’s the hundreds, thousands, or millions of littlethings that separate the ordinary from the extraordinary. To beone stroke better requires countless little things that don’t getaccounted for when you’re putting on the green jacket.Let me give you a few more ways tracking small changes canresult in huge payoffs.Take a WalkI was mentoring a CEO of a sizeable company doing morethan $100 million in sales annually. Phil was an entrepreneurand founder of the company ne, butI detected a lack of engagement, trust, and enthusiasm in theculture of his organization. I wasn’t too surprised; it turns outthat Phil hadn’t been in parts of his own building for more thanve years! He’d never spoken personally to more than 80 percentof his staff! He basically lived in a bubble with his managementteam. I asked Phil to track just one change: three times a week,he had to step outside of his of ce and walk around the building.His goal was to seek out at least three people whom he sawdoing things right or had heard good things about and givethem some personal acknowledgment of his appreciation. Thisone small change in his behavior took less than an hour a week,but had massive effects over time. The employees Phil took thetime to recognize began to go the extra mile and work harderto earn his greater appreciation. Other employees started toperform better, observing that great effort was recognized andChapter_2.indd   44Chapter_2.indd   444/21/10   12:59:40 PM4/21/10   12:59:40 PM45CHOICESappreciated. The ripple effect of their new attitude transferred totheir customer interactions, improving the customers’ experiencewith the company, increasing repeat and referral business,which increased everyone’s pride. That simple change over theperiod of eighteen months did a complete 180 on the companyculture. Net pr ts grew by more than 30 percent during thattime, utilizing the same staff and zero additional investment inmarketing. All because Phil committed to one small, seeminglycant step done consistently over time.Money TreeTwelve years ago I had a wonderful assistant, Kathleen. Sheearned $40,000 a year at the time. She was tasked to manage theregistration table situated at the back of the room during one of mylectures on entrepreneurship and wealth building. The next weekshe came into my of ce. “I heard you talk about saving 10 percentof everything you earn,” she told me. “That sounds nice, but thereis no way I could do that. It’s totally unrealistic!” She proceeded tonancial obligations. After she wrotethem all out, it was obvious there really wasn’t any money left overat the end of the month. “I need a raise,” she said.“I’ll do better than that,” I told her. “I’m going to teach you howto become wealthy.” It wasn’t the answer she was looking for, butshe agreed.I taught Kathleen how to track her spending, and she began tocarry her notebook. I told her to open a separate savings accountwith only $33—just 1 percent of her existing monthly income. I thenshowed her how to live on $33 less the next month—bring in herChapter_2.indd   45Chapter_2.indd   454/21/10   12:59:42 PM
deli and ordering a sandwich, chips, and a drink. The next month Ihad her save only 2 percent ($67). She saved the additional $33 bychanging her cable subscription service. The next month we wentup to 3 percent. We canceled her subscription toPeople magazine (itwas time to study her own life), and instead of going to Starbuckstwice a week, I told Kathleen to buy the Starbucks beans and otherxings and make her own coffee in the of ce (she grew to likethat even better—me too!).By the end of the year, Kathleen was saving 10 percent of everycant impact on herlifestyle. She was amazed! That one discipline also had a rippleeffect on many other disciplines in her life. She calculated what shespent on mind-numbing entertainment and began investing thatmoney on personal growth instead. After feeding her mind withseveral hundred hours of inspirational and instructional content,her creativity started to soar. She brought me several ideas on howwe could make and save more money in our organization. Shepresented me with a plan that she would implement in her sparetime, if I promised to reward her with 10 percent of all the money-saving strategies and 15 percent of all the new revenue strategiesthat proved pr table. By the end of the second year, she wasearning more than $100,000 a year—on the same $40,000 base salary.Kathleen eventually started her own independent contract servicebusiness that took off. I ran into Kathleen at an airport two yearsago. She now earns more than a quarter of a million dollars a yearand has saved and created more than $1 million in assets—she’s amillionaire! All starting from the choice to take one small step andstart saving $33 a month!Chapter_2.indd   46Chapter_2.indd   464/21/10   12:59:44 PM4/21/10   12:59:44 PM47CHOICESTime Is of the EssenceThe earlier you start making small changes, the more powerfullythe Compound Effect works in your favor. Suppose your friendlistened to Dave Ramsey’s advice and began putting $250 amonth into an IRA rst job after graduatingfrom college at age twenty-three. You, on the other hand, don’tstart saving until you’re forty. (Or maybe you started saving alittle earlier but cleaned out your retirement account becauseyou didn’t notice any great gains.) By the time your friend isforty, she never has to invest another dollar and will have morethan a $1 million by the age of sixty-seven, growing at 8 percentinterest compounded monthly. You continue to invest $250 everymonth until you reach sixty-seven, the normal retirement agefor Social Security for those born after 1960. (That means you’resaving for twenty-seven years in contrast to her seventeen years.)When you’re ready to retire, you’ll have less than $300,000 andwill have invested $27,000 more than your friend. Even thoughyou saved for many more years and invested much more cash,you still ended up with less than a third of the money you couldhave had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate andneglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. Don’t waitanother day to start the small disciplines that will lead you in thedirection of your goals! See Figure 5.Are you telling yourself that you’re starting so late thatyou’re already way behind the eight ball and can never catchup? That’s just another tired tape in your head; it’s time to turnit off. It’s never too late to r ts of the CompoundEffect.

Every great act, every fantastic adventure, startsrst step always looks harder than itactually is. ve years is too long? What if you’ve onlygot time or patience for ten years? In Brian Tracy’s bookFocal Point (Amacom, 2002), he models how to improve any area ofyour life by 1,000 percent. Not 10 percent or even 100 percent,but 1,000 percent! Let me outline it for you.All you have to do is improve yourself, your performance, andyour output and earnings by 1/10 of 1 percent each workday (youeven get to slack off on weekends). That is 1/1,000. Do you thinkyou could do that? Of course, anyone could do that. Simple. Do iteach day of the week, and you’ll improve by ½ percent each week(translation: not much), equaling 2 percent each month, which,compounded, adds up to 26 percent each year. Your income nowdoubles each 2.9 years. By Year Ten, you can be performing andearning 1,000 percent what you are now. Isn’t that amazing?You don’t have to put in 1,000 percent more effort or work 1,000percent more hours. Just 1/10 of 1 percent improvement each day.That’s it.Success Is a (Half-) Marathon Beverly was a salesperson for an educational softwarecompany for which I was doing a turnaround. One day shetold me about her friend who was running a half-marathon theupcoming weekend. “I could never do such a thing,” Beverly,Chapter_2.indd   Sec1:49Chapter_2.indd   Sec1:494/21/10   12:59:52 PM
ight of stairs!”“If you want to, you can choose to do what your friend is doing,” I told her. She balked, saying, “There’s absolutelyno way.”nd her motivation. “So,Beverly, why would you want to run the half-marathon?”“Well, my twenty-year high-school reunion is coming up nextsummer, and I want to look fabulous. But I’ve gained so muchve years ago. I don’t knowhow I can do it.” Bingo! Now we had a motivating goal. But I proceeded withcaution. If you’ve ever tried to lose weight, you probably knowthe drill: Buy an expensive gym membership, drop a fortuneon personal trainers, new equipment, spiffy new workoutclothes, and great athletic footwear. Work out vigorouslyfor a week or so and then turn your elliptical machine intoa clothes-drying rack, ditch the gym, and let your sneakersmold in the corner. I wanted to try a better way with Beverly. Iknew that if I could get her to choose just one new habit, she’dget hooked, and all the other behaviors would naturally fallinto line.I asked Beverly to drive her car around the block and map outa one-mile loop from her house. Then, I told her to walk the loopthree times over a period of two weeks. Notice that I didn’t ask herto start by running the mile. Instead, I started with something—asmall, easy task that required no major stretch. Then I had herwalk the loop three times in one week for an additional twoweeks. Each day she made the choice to continue on. Chapter_2.indd   Sec1:50Chapter_2.indd   Sec1:504/21/10   12:59:54 PM4/21/10   12:59:54 PM51CHOICESNext I told Beverly to start a slow jog, only as far as she felt comfortable. As soon as she started feeling breathless, she was tostop and continue walking. I asked her to do this until she couldrun one-fourth, then one-half, and then three-quarters of thatmile. It took three more weeks—nine outings—before she couldjog a full mile. After a total of seven weeks, she was jogging thewhole loop. That might seem like a long time for such a shortvictory, right? After all, half of a marathon is 13.1 miles. One mileis nothing. What was something, however, was that Beverly wast for the reunion—herwhy-power (as I’ll soon explain)—was fueling her new healthhabits. The Compound Effect had been set in motion and wasstarting its miraculous process.I then asked Beverly to increase her distance an eighth of amile each outing (an almost unnoticeable length, maybe only 300steps further). Within six months, she was runningnine mileswithout any discomfort at all. In nine months, she was running13.5 miles regularly (more than the distance of a half-marathon)as part of her running routine. More exciting, though, was whathappened in other areas of her life. Beverly lost her cravings forchocolate (a lifelong obsession) and heavy, fatty foods. Gone. Theincreased energy she felt from the cardiovascular exercise andbetter eating choices helped her bring more enthusiasm to herwork. Her sales performance doubled during the same period(which was great for me!).As we saw in the previous chapter, the ripple effects of allthis momentum raised her self-esteem which made her moreaffectionate toward her husband. Their relationship becamemore passionate than it had been since college. Because sheChapter_2.indd   Sec1:51Chapter_2.indd   Sec1:514/21/10   12:59:57 PM
more active and animated. She noticed she no longer had time tohang out with her “Debbie Downer” friends, who still gatheredtogether after work for greasy appetizers and drinks. She madenew “healthy” friends in a running club she joined—whichled to a whole host of additional positive choices, behaviors,and habits.  rst conversation in my of ce and Beverly’snd her why-power and commit to a series of smallsteps, she lost more than forty pounds, becoming a walking(and running) billboar t and empowered women. Today,Beverly runs full marathons!Your life is the product of your moment-to-moment choices.In our SUCCESS CD (May 2010), TV’s Biggest Loser tness trainerJillian Michaels shared with me a powerful childhood story:“When I was a kid, my mom would have these elaborate Easteregg hunts for me. I would run around the house, and when Iwould get close to a hidden egg, she’d say, ‘Oh you’re warm.’You know, you get closer to it, ‘Oh, you’r re.’ And then youmove away from the egg and she’d go, ‘Oh, you’re cold, you’refreezing.’ I teach contestants that, on a moment-to-moment basis,I need them to think about their happiness and their ultimate goalas being warm—how every choice and every decision they makein the moment is getting them closer to that ultimate goal.” Since your outcomes are all a result of your moment-to-moment choices, you have incredible power to change your lifeby changing those choices. Step by step, day by day, your choiceswill shape your actions until they become habits, where practicemakes them permanent.
