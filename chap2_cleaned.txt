CHAPTER 2 CHOICES
We all come into this world the same: naked, scared, and ignorant. After that grand entrance, the life we end up with is  simply an accumulation of all the choices we make. Our choices can be our best friend or our worst enemy. They can deliver us to  our goals or send us orbiting into a galaxy far, far away. Think about it. Everything in your life exists because you rst made a choice about something. Choices are at the root of every one of your results. Each choice starts a behavior that  over time becomes a habit. Choose poorly, and you just might  nd yourself back at the drawing board, forced to make new,  often harder choices. Don’t choose at all, and you’ve made the  choice to be the passive receiver of whatever comes your way. In essence, you make your choices, and then your choices make you. Every decision, no matter how slight, alters the trajectory of  your life—whether or not to go to college, who to marry, to have that    one more prospecting call or call it a day, to say I love you or not.  Every choice has an impact on the Compound Effect of your life. This chapter is about becoming aware of and making choices that support the expansion of your life. Sounds complicated, but you’ll be amazed by its simplicity. No longer will 99 percent of  your choices be unconscious. No more will most of your daily  routines and traditions come as a reaction to your programming.  You’ll ask yourself (and be able to answer), “How many of my  behaviors have I not ‘voted on’? What am I doing that I didn’t consciously choose to do, yet continue to do every day?” By employing the same idiot-proof strategies I’ve used to catapult my own life and career, strengthened by the Compound  Effect, you’ll be able to loosen the mysterious grip of the things that  are unwinding your life and pulling you in the wrong direction.  You’ll be able to hit the Pause button before stumbling into idiot  territory. You’ll experience the ease of making decisions that lead  to behaviors and habits that support you, every time. Your biggest challenge isn’t that you’ve intentionally been x. Your biggest  challenge is that you’ve been sleepwalking through your choices. Half the time, you’re not even aware you’re making them! Our  choices are often shaped by our culture and upbringing. They can  be so entwined in our routine behaviors and habits that they seem  beyond our control. For instance, have you ever been going about  your business, enjoying your life, when all of sudden you made a  stupid choice or series of small choices that ultimately sabotaged  your hard work and momentum, all for no apparent reason?  You didn’t intend to sabotage yourself, but by not thinking about    found yourself facing unintended consequences. Nobody intends to become obese, go through bankruptcy, or get a divorce, but  often (if not always) those consequences are the result of a series  of small, poor choices. Elephants Don’t Bite Have you ever been bitten by an elephant? How about a mosquito? It’s the little things in life that will bite you. Occasionally, we see big mistakes threaten to destroy a career or  reputation in an instant—the famous comedian who rants racial  slurs during a stand-up routine, the drunken anti-Semitic antics  of a once-celebrated humanitarian, the anti-gay-rights senator caught soliciting gay sex in a restroom, the admired female  tennis player who uncharacteristically threatens an of cial with  a tirade of expletives. Clearly, these types of poor choices have  major repercussions. But even if you’ve pulled such a whopper  in your past, it’s not extraordinary massive steps backward or  the tragic single moments that we’re concerned with here. For most of us, it’s the frequent, small, and seemingly inconsequential choices that are of grave concern. I’m talking  about the decisions you think don’t make any difference at all.  It’s the little things that inevitably and predictably derail your  success. Whether they’re bone-headed maneuvers, no-biggie  behaviors, or are disguised as positive choices (those are especially  cant decisions can completely  throw you off course because you’re not mindful of them. You get  overwhelmed, space out, and become unaware of the little actions    right. It always works, remember? But in this case it works against you because you’re doing… you’re sleepwalking. For instance, you inhale a soda and bag of potato chips and suddenly realize only after you polished off the last chip that  you blew an entire day of healthy eating—and you weren’t  even hungry. You get caught up and lose two hours watching  mindless TV—scratch that, let’s give you some credit and make  it an educational documentary—before realizing you spaced on  preparing for an important presentation to land a valuable client.  You blurt out a knee-jerk lie to a loved one for no good reason,  when the tr ne. What’s going on? You’ve allowed yourself to make a choice without thinking. And as long as you’re making choices unconsciously, you can’t  consciously choose to change that ineffective behavior and  turn it into productive habits. It’s time to WAKE UP and make  empowering choices. Thanksgiving Year-Round ngers at others, isn’t it? “I’m not getting ahead because of my lame boss.” “I would have gotten that promotion if it hadn’t been for that backstabbing co-worker.” “I’m  always in a bad mood because my kids are driving me crazy.”  And we’r nger-pointing department  when it comes to our romantic relationships—you know, where  the other person is the one who needs to change. A few years back, a friend of mine was complaining about his wife. Fr c lady, and he was    all the ways she was responsible for his unhappiness. That’s when  I shared an experience that had literally changed my marriage.  One Thanksgiving, I decided to keep a Thanks Giving journal for  my wife. Every day for an entire year I logged at least one thing  I appreciated about her—the way she interacted with her friends,  how she cared for our dogs, the fresh bed she prepared, a succulent  meal she whipped up, or the beautiful way she styled her hair that  day—whatever. I looked for the things my wife was doing that  touched me, or revealed attributes, characteristics, or qualities I  appreciated. I wrote them all down secretly for the entire year. By  the end of that year lled an entire journal. When I gave it to her the following Thanksgiving, she cried, calling it the best gift she’d ever received. (Even better  than the BMW I’d given her for her birthday!) The funny  thing was that the person most affected by this gift was me.  All that journaling forced me to focus on my wife’s positive  aspects. I was consciously looking for all the things she was  doing “right.” That heartfelt focus overwhelmed anything I  might have otherwise complained about. I fell deeply in love  with her all over again (maybe even more than ever, as I was  seeing subtleties in her nature and behavior instead of her more  obvious qualities). My appreciation, gratitude, and intention to  nd the best in her was something I held in my heart and eyes  each day. This caused me to show up differently in my marriage,  which, of course, made her respond differently to me. Soon, I  had even more things to write in my Thanks Giving journal! As  a result of choosing to take a mer ve minutes every day or  so to document all the reasons why I was grateful for her, we   THE COMPOUND  EFFECT experienced one of the best years of our marriage, and it’s only gotten better. After I shared my experience, my friend decided to keep a Thanks Giving journal about his wife. W rst few months, he completely turned around his marriage. Choosing to look for and focus on his wife’s positive qualities changed his view of her, which changed how he interacted with her. As a result, she made different choices about the way she responded to him. The cycle perpetuated. Or, shall we say, compounded .

Owning 100 Percent We are all self-made men and women, but only the successful take credit for it. I was eighteen when I was introduced to the idea of personal responsibility at a seminar, and the concept completely transformed my life. If you threw out the rest of this book and only practiced this one concept, within two to three years the changes in your life would be so great, your friends and family would have dif culty remembering the “old you.” In that seminar I attended at eighteen, the speaker asked, “What percentage of shared responsibility do you have in making a relationship work?” I was a teenager, so wise in the ways of true love. Of course I had all the answers. 29CHOICES fty!” I blurted out. It was so obvious; both people must be willing to share the responsibility evenly or someone’s  getting ripped off. “Fifty-one/forty-nine,” yelled someone else, arguing that you’d have to be willing to do more than the other person. Aren’t  r ce and generosity? “Eighty/twenty,” yelled another.  The instructor turned to the easel and wrote 100/0 on the paper in big black letters. “You have to be willing to give 100 percent with  zero expectation of receiving anything in return,” he said. “Only  when you’re willing to take 100 percent responsibility for making  the relationship work will it work. Otherwise, a relationship left  to chance will always be vulnerable to disaster.” Whoa. This wasn’t what I was expecting! But I quickly understood how this concept could transform every area of my  life. If I always took 100 percent responsibility for everything I  experienced—completely owning all of my choices and all the ways I responded to whatever happened to me—I held the power.  Everything was up to me. I was responsible for everything I did,  didn’t do, or how I responded to what was done to me. I know you think you take responsibility for your life. I’ve yet to ask anybody who doesn’t say, “Of course, I take responsibility for my life.” But then you look at how most people operate in the world;  ther nger pointing, victimhood, blaming, and expecting  someone else or the government to solve their problems. If you’ve  ever blamed traf c for being late, or decided you are in a bad mood  because of something your kid, spouse, or co-worker did, you’re not  taking 100 percent personal responsibility. You arrived late because  the printer was busy? Maybe you shouldn’t have waited until the    have double-checked it yourself before delivering it? Not getting  along with your unreasonable teen? There are a countless fantastic  books and classes to help you learn how to deal. You alone are responsible for what you do, don’t do , or how you respond to what’s done to you. This empowering mindset revolutionized my life. Luck, circumstances, or the right situation  wasn’t what mattered. If it was to be, it was up to me. I was fr y. No matter who was elected president, how badly  the economy tanked, or what anybody said, did, or didn’t do, I was still 100 percent in control of me. Through choosing to be of cially liberated from past, present, and future victimhood, I’d  hit the jackpot. I had the unlimited power to control my destiny. Getting Lucky Maybe you believe you’re simply unlucky. But really, that’s just another excuse. The difference between becoming fabulously  rich, happy, and healthy, or broke, depressed, and unhealthy, is  the choices you make throughout life. Nothing else will make the  difference. Here’s the thing about luck: We’re all lucky. If you are on  the right side of the dirt, have your health, and a little food in your  cupboard, you are incredibly lucky. Everyone has the opportunity  to be “lucky,” because beyond having the basics of health and  sustenance, luck simply comes down to a series of choices. When I asked Richard Branson if he felt luck played a part in his success, he answered, “Yes, of course, we are all lucky. If you  live in a free society, you are lucky. Luck surrounds us every day;  we are constantly having lucky things happen to us, whether you    than anyone else. The difference is when luck came my way, I took  advantage of it.” Ah, spoken like a man knighted with wisdom. While we’re on the topic, it’s my belief that the old adage we often hear—“Luck is when opportunity meets preparation”—isn’t enough. I believe  there are two other critical components to “luck.” The (Complete) Formula for Getting Lucky:  Preparation (personal growth) + Attitude (belief/mindset) + Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) + Action (doing something about it) =Luck Preparation: By consistently improving and preparing yourself— your skills, knowledge, expertise, relationships, and resources—you  have the wherewithal to take advantage of great opportunities  when they arise (when luck “strikes”). Then, you can be like Arnold  Palmer, who told SUCCESS magazine in February of 2009, “It’s a funny thing; the more I practice, the luckier I get.” Attitude: This is where luck evades most people, and where Sir Richard is spot-on with his belief that luck is all around us.  It’s simply a matter of seeing situations, conversations, and  circumstances as fortuitous. You cannot see what you don’t look  for, and you cannot look for what you don’t believe in. Opportunity: It’s possible to make your own luck, but the luck I’m talking about here isn’t planned for, or it comes faster or  differently than expected. In this stage of the formula, luck isn’t    of its own accord. Action: This is where you come in. However this luck was delivered to you—from the universe, God, the Lucky Charms  leprechaun, or whomever or whatever you associate delivering  your good fortune—it’s now your job to act on it. This is what  separates the Richard Bransons from the Joseph Wallingtons.  Joseph who? Exactly. You’ve never heard of him. That’s because he  failed to take action on all the lucky things that happened to him. So no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the great defeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. Countless  people have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you,  and yet they’re wealthier and mor lled. Luck is an equal-  opportunity distributor. Lady luck shines on all, but rather than  having your umbrella drawn, you’ve got  to have your face to  the sky. When it comes down to it, it’s all you, baby. There’s no  other way around it. The High Price of Tuition at UHK  (University of Hard Knocks) Nearly a decade ago I was asked to be a partner in a new startup venture. I invested a considerable sum of money into the deal and  worked tirelessly on it for nearly two years befor nding out that  my partner had mismanaged and squandered all the cash. I lost  more than $330,000. I didn’t try to sue him; in fact, I lent him more  money later for a personal situation. The bottom line was the loss  was my fault. I had agreed to be his partner without doing enough  due diligence on his background and personal character. During    could justify it by saying I trusted him, but the truth was I was  nances more diligently.  Not only had I made the choice to start this relationship and  business, but I’d also made many choices to ignore obvious red  ags and warning signs. Because I chose to not be completely  responsible for the business, in the end, I was responsible for the  results. When I learned of the wrongdoings, I chose not to lose any  mor ghting it. Instead, I licked my wounds, learned my  lesson, and moved on. In hindsight, I’d make the same choice to  pick up and move on again today. I now challenge you to do the same. No matter what has happened to you, take complete responsibility for it—good or  bad, victory or defeat. Own it. My mentor Jim Rohn said, “The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you  take full responsibility for your life.” Today is graduation day! From this day forward, choose to be 100 percent responsible for your life. Eliminate all of your  excuses. Embrace the fact that you are freed by your choices, as  long as you assume personal responsibility for them. It’s time to make the choice to take control. Your Secret Weapon—Your Scorecard I’m about to walk you through one of the single greatest strategies I’ve ever used in my personal development. This strategy helps  me take control of the choices I make throughout the day, causing  everything else to fall into place, and leading to behaviors and actions  that shepherd my habits into line like dutiful, loyal minions.   want to be successful. Do you want more money in the bank?  A trimmer waistline? The strength to compete in an Iron Man  event? A better relationship with your spouse or kids? Picture  where you are in that area, right now. Now picture where you  want to be: richer, thinner, happier rst step  toward change is awareness. If you want to get from where you  are to where you want to be, you have to start by becoming aware  of the choices that lead you away from your desired destination.  Become very conscious of every choice you make today so you can begin to make smarter choices moving forward. To help you become aware of your choices, I want you to track every action that relates to the area of your life you want to improve. If you’ve decided you want get out of debt, you’re going to track  every penny you pull from your pocket. If you’ve decided you want  to lose weight, you’re going to track everything you put into your  mouth. If you’ve decided to train for an athletic event, you’re going  to track every step you take, every workout you do. Simply carry  around a small notebook, something you’ll keep in your pocket or  purse at all times, and a writing instrument. You’re going to write it  all down. Every day. Without fail. No excuses, no exceptions. As if  Big Brother’s watching you. As if my dad and I will come and make  you do a hundred pushups every time you miss. Doesn’t sound like much, I know—writing things down on a little piece of paper. But tracking my progress and missteps is the one of the reasons I’ve accumulated the success I have. The process  forces you to be conscious of your decisions. But as Jim Rohn would  say, “What’s simple to do is also simple not to do.” The magic is not  in the complexity of the task; the magic is in the doing of simple    Compound Effect. So, beware of neglecting the simple things that  make the big things in your life possible. The biggest difference  between successful people and unsuccessful people is that  successful people are willing to do what unsuccessful people are  not. Remember that; it will come in handy many times throughout  life when faced with a dif cult, tedious, or tough choice. Money Trap I learned the power of tracking the hard way, after I’d acted nances. Back in my early twenties,  when I was making a lot of money selling real estate, I met with  my accountant. “You owe well over $100,000 in taxes,” he said.  “What?!” I said. “I don’t have that kind of cash just lying around.” “Why not?” he asked. “You collected several times that; certainly you set aside the taxes that would be due on that money.” “Evidently I didn’t,” I said. “Where did the money go?” he asked.  “I don’t know,” I said, a sobering confession, for sure. The money had passed through my hands like water, and I hadn’t  even noticed! Then my accountant did me a great favor.  “Son,” he said, looking me dead in the eyes, “you’ve got to get a grip. I’ve seen this a hundred times before. You’re spending money  like a drunken fool, and you don’t even know how to account for  it. That’s stupid. Stop it. You are now seriously in the hole. You    to pay for your back taxes. Continue this, and you’ll dig your  nancial grave with your own wallet.” I immediately got the message. Here’s what my accountant had me do: carry a small notepad in my back pocket, and write down every single cent I spent for thirty days. Whether it was a thousand dollars for a new suit or fty cents for air to  ll up my tires, it all had to go down on the  notepad. Wow. This brought an instantaneous awareness of the  many unconscious choices I was making that resulted in money  pouring out of my pockets. Because I had to log everything, I resisted buying some things, just so I didn’t have to take out the  notepad and write it in the dang book! Keeping a money log for thirty days straight cemented a new awareness in me, and created a completely new set of choices  and disciplines around my spending. And, since awareness  and positive behaviors compound, I found myself being more proactive with money in general, putting away more for  retir nding areas to save where there was clear waste,  and enjoying the fun quotient of money—“play money”—all the more. When I did consider shelling out for entertainment, I did so  only after a long pause. This tracking exercise changed my awareness of how I related to my money. It worked so well, in fact, that I’ve used  it many times to change other behaviors. Tracking is my go-to  transformation model for everything that ails me. Over the years I’ve tracked what I eat and drink, how much I exercise, how  much time I spend improving a skill, my number of sales calls,  even the improvement of my relationships with family, friends,    money-tracking wake-up call. In buying this book, you’re basically paying me for my opinion, my guidance. This is where I’m going to become a hard-ass and  insist you track your behaviors for at least one whole week. This book isn’t designed to entertain you; it is designed to help you get results. To get results, you have to take some action. You may have heard about tracking before. In fact, you’ve probably done your own version of this exercise. But I also bet  you aren’t doing it now, right? How do I know? Because your life isn’t working as successfully as you’d like. You’ve gotten derailed. Tracking is the way to get it back on track. Do you know how the casinos make so much money in Vegas? Because they track every table, every winner, every hour. Why do  Olympic trainers get paid top dollar? Because they track every workout, every calorie, and every micronutrient for their athletes.  All winners are trackers. Right now I want you to track your life  with the same intention: to bring your goals within sight. Tracking is a simple exercise. It works because it brings moment-to-moment awareness to the actions you take in the  area of your life you want to improve. You’ll be surprised at  what you will observe about your behavior. You cannot manage  or improve something until you measure it. Likewise, you can’t  make the most of who you are—your talents and resources and  capabilities—until you are aware of and accountable for your  actions. Every professional athlete and his or her coach track  each performance down to the smallest minutiae. Pitchers know their stats on every pitch in their repertoire. Golfers have even  more metrics on their swings. Professional athletes know how to   pay attention to what they record and make changes accordingly,  because they know when their stats improve they win more  games and earn more in endorsement deals. At any given moment, I want you to know exactly how well you’re doing. I’m asking you to track yourself as if you’re a  valuable commodity. Because you are. Want that idiot-proof  system we talked about earlier? This is it. So, regardless of  whether you think you’re aware of your habits or not (believe  me, you’re not!), I’m asking you to start tracking. Doing so will  revolutionize your life, and ultimately, your lifestyle. Keep It Slow and Easy Don’t panic. We’re starting off with an easy, breezy tempo. Just track one habit for one week. Pick the habit that has the greatest control over you; that’s where you’ll start. Once you begin  reaping the rewards of the Compound Effect, you’ll naturally  want to introduce this practice into other areas of your life. In  other words, you’ll choose to choose tracking. Let’s say the category you choose is getting your eating under control because you want to lose weight. Your task is to  write down everything you put in your mouth, from the steak,  potatoes, and salad you have at dinner, to those many tiny choices  during the day—that handful of pretzels in the break room, that  second slice of cheese on your sandwich, that “fun-sized” candy bar, that sample at Costco, those extra sips of wine after the host  tops off your glass. Don’t forget the beverages. They all add up,  but unless tracked, they’re easy to dismiss or forget because they    simple—and it is—BUT ONLY WHEN YOU DO IT. That’s why I’m asking that you commit to choosing a category and a start date, now, before you turn this page . I am going to start tracking _______________ on ____________. [date/month/year]What will the tracking look like? It will be thorough, as in organized. And relentless, as in constant. Each day  you’ll start with the date at the top of a fresh page, and start  keeping track. rst week of tracking? You’ll probably be in shock. You’ll be astonished at how those calories, pennies,  minutes have been escaping you. You never even knew that they  were there, let alone that they’d vanished. Now, keep going. You’re going to track in this one area for three weeks. Maybe you’re already groaning; you just don’t want to do it. But trust me: You’ll be so blown away by the results after one  week you’ll sign yourself up for another two. I can practically  guarantee it. Why three weeks? You’ve heard psychologists say that something doesn’t become a habit until you practice it for three  weeks. It’s not an exact science, but it’s a good benchmark,  and it has worked for me. So, ideally, I want you to stick with  your choice to track your behaviors for twenty-one days. If  you refuse, I’m not going to lose anything (heck, it’s not my  waistline, cardiovascular health, bank balance, or relationship  you’re messing with!). But, seriously, you’re reading this book  because you want to change your life, right? And I promised    action isn’t easy, but it’s simple and doable. So do it. Promise yourself to start. Today. For the next three weeks, choose to carry around your own small notepad (or large one, if that’s  more enticing), and write every single thing down in your category. What happens in three weeks? You move from the shock that rst week to the happy surprise of seeing how merely  becoming conscious of your actions begins to shape them. You’ll  nd yourself asking, “Do I really want that candy bar? I’m gonna  have to haul out my notebook and write it down, and I’ll feel a  little sheepish.” That’s two hundred calories saved right there. Turn  down that candy bar every day, and in a little more than two weeks,  you’ll have already lost a pound! You’ll start adding up that $4.00  coffee on the way to work and realize, Holy cow! I’ve just spent sixty bucks on coffee in three weeks! Hey, that’s a thousand bucks a year! Or,  compounded, that’s $51,833.79 in twenty years! How much do you  really need to stop for coffee? See Figure 3. Come again? Am I saying that your four-dollar-a-day coffee habit is going to cost you $51,833.79 in twenty years? Yes, I am.  Did you know that every dollar you spend today, no matter where  ve dollars in only twenty  years (and ten dollars in thirty years)? That’s because if you took a dollar and invested it at 8 percent, in twenty years, that dollar  ve. Every time you spend a buck today,  ve dollars out of your future pocket.

In other words, every fty dollars you have to ask,  “Is this item worth $250?” If it’s worth $250 to you today, then  it’s worth buying.

You’ll be able to ask  yourself, “Is having a coffee once every workday worth the  eventual price of a Mercedes-Benz?” Because that’s what it’s  costing you. Even more than that, you’re not sleepwalking  anymore. You’re aware and conscious and making better  choices. All from a little notebook and pen. Simply amazing,  isn’t it? The Unsung, Unseen Hero Once you start tracking your life, your attention will be focused on the smallest things you’re doing right, as well as  the smallest things you’re doing wrong. And when you choose  to make even the smallest course corrections consistently, over  time, you’ll begin to see amazing results. But don’t expect  immediate fanfare. When I say “small” course corrections, I’m  talking truly invisible. Chances are no one’s going to notice  them anytime soon. There will be no applause. No one’s  going to send you a congratulations card or a trophy for these  disciplines. And yet, eventually, their compounding effect  will result in an exceptional payoff. It’s the littlest disciplines  that pay off over time, the effort and preparation for the great  triumph that happened when no one was looking. And yet  the results are exceptional. A horse wins by a nose, but gets  10 times the prize money. Is the horse 10 times faster? No,  just a little bit better. But it was those extra laps around the    work by the jockey that made the results a slight bit better  with compounded rewards.

It’s not the big things that add up  in the end; it’s the hundreds, thousands, or millions of little  things that separate the ordinary from the extraordinary. To be  one stroke better requires countless little things that don’t get  accounted for when you’re putting on the green jacket. Let me give you a few more ways tracking small changes can result in huge payoffs. Take a Walk I was mentoring a CEO of a sizeable company doing more than $100 million in sales annually. Phil was an entrepreneur  and founder of the company ne, but  I detected a lack of engagement, trust, and enthusiasm in the  culture of his organization. I wasn’t too surprised; it turns out  that Phil hadn’t been in parts of his own building for more than  ve years! He’d never spoken personally to more than 80 percent  of his staff! He basically lived in a bubble with his management  team. I asked Phil to track just one change: three times a week,  he had to step outside of his of ce and walk around the building.  His goal was to seek out at least three people whom he saw  doing things right or had heard good things about and give  them some personal acknowledgment of his appreciation. This  one small change in his behavior took less than an hour a week, but had massive effects over time. The employees Phil took the  time to recognize began to go the extra mile and work harder  to earn his greater appreciation. Other employees started to  perform better, observing that great effort was recognized and    their customer interactions, improving the customers’ experience  with the company, increasing repeat and referral business,  which increased everyone’s pride. That simple change over the  period of eighteen months did a complete 180 on the company culture. Net pr ts grew by more than 30 percent during that  time, utilizing the same staff and zero additional investment in  marketing. All because Phil committed to one small, seemingly  cant step done consistently over time. Money Tree Twelve years ago I had a wonderful assistant, Kathleen. She earned $40,000 a year at the time. She was tasked to manage the  registration table situated at the back of the room during one of my  lectures on entrepreneurship and wealth building. The next week  she came into my of ce. “I heard you talk about saving 10 percent  of everything you earn,” she told me. “That sounds nice, but there  is no way I could do that. It’s totally unrealistic!” She proceeded to  nancial obligations. After she wrote  them all out, it was obvious there really wasn’t any money left over  at the end of the month. “I need a raise,” she said. “I’ll do better than that,” I told her. “I’m going to teach you how to become wealthy.” It wasn’t the answer she was looking for, but  she agreed. I taught Kathleen how to track her spending, and she began to carry her notebook. I told her to open a separate savings account  with only $33—just 1 percent of her existing monthly income. I then  showed her how to live on $33 less the next month—bring in her    deli and ordering a sandwich, chips, and a drink. The next month I  had her save only 2 percent ($67). She saved the additional $33 by  changing her cable subscription service. The next month we went  up to 3 percent. We canceled her subscription to People magazine (it was time to study her own life), and instead of going to Starbucks twice a week, I told Kathleen to buy the Starbucks beans and other  xings and make her own coffee in the of ce (she grew to like  that even better—me too!). By the end of the year, Kathleen was saving 10 percent of every cant impact on her  lifestyle. She was amazed! That one discipline also had a ripple  effect on many other disciplines in her life. She calculated what she  spent on mind-numbing entertainment and began investing that  money on personal growth instead. After feeding her mind with  several hundred hours of inspirational and instructional content,  her creativity started to soar. She brought me several ideas on how  we could make and save more money in our organization. She  presented me with a plan that she would implement in her spare  time, if I promised to reward her with 10 percent of all the money-  saving strategies and 15 percent of all the new revenue strategies  that proved pr table. By the end of the second year, she was  earning more than $100,000 a year—on the same $40,000 base salary.  Kathleen eventually started her own independent contract service  business that took off. I ran into Kathleen at an airport two years  ago. She now earns more than a quarter of a million dollars a year  and has saved and created more than $1 million in assets—she’s a  millionaire! All starting from the choice to take one small step and  start saving $33 a month!   The earlier you start making small changes, the more powerfully the Compound Effect works in your favor. Suppose your friend  listened to Dave Ramsey’s advice and began putting $250 a month into an IRA rst job after graduating  from college at age twenty-three. You, on the other hand, don’t  start saving until you’re forty. (Or maybe you started saving a  little earlier but cleaned out your retirement account because  you didn’t notice any great gains.) By the time your friend is  forty, she never has to invest another dollar and will have more  than a $1 million by the age of sixty-seven, growing at 8 percent  interest compounded monthly. You continue to invest $250 every  month until you reach sixty-seven, the normal retirement age  for Social Security for those born after 1960. (That means you’re  saving for twenty-seven years in contrast to her seventeen years.) When you’re ready to retire, you’ll have less than $300,000 and  will have invested $27,000 more than your friend. Even though  you saved for many more years and invested much more cash,  you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could  have had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate and  neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. Don’t wait another day to start the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals! See Figure 5. Are you telling yourself that you’re starting so late that you’re already way behind the eight ball and can never catch  up? That’s just another tired tape in your head; it’s time to turn  it off. It’s never too late to r ts of the Compound  Effect. Suppose you’ve always wanted to play the piano, but  feel it’s too late because you’re about to turn forty.

The key is to  start NOW. Every great act, every fantastic adventure, starts  rst step always looks harder than it  actually is. ve years is too long? What if you’ve only got time or patience for ten years? In Brian Tracy’s book Focal Point (Amacom, 2002), he models how to improve any area of your life by 1,000 percent. Not 10 percent or even 100 percent,  but 1,000 percent! Let me outline it for you. All you have to do is improve yourself, your performance, and your output and earnings by 1/10 of 1 percent each workday (you  even get to slack off on weekends). That is 1/1,000. Do you think  you could do that? Of course, anyone could do that. Simple. Do it  each day of the week, and you’ll improve by ½ percent each week  (translation: not much), equaling 2 percent each month, which,  compounded, adds up to 26 percent each year. Your income now  doubles each 2.9 years. By Year Ten, you can be performing and  earning 1,000 percent what you are now. Isn’t that amazing?  You don’t have to put in 1,000 percent more effort or work 1,000  percent more hours. Just 1/10 of 1 percent improvement each day.  That’s it. Success Is a (Half-) Marathon Beverly was a salesperson for an educational software company for which I was doing a turnaround. One day she  told me about her friend who was running a half-marathon the  upcoming weekend. “I could never do such a thing,” Beverly,    ight of stairs!” “If you want to, you can choose to do what your friend is doing,” I told her. She balked, saying, “There’s absolutely  no way.” nd her motivation. “So, Beverly, why would you want to run the half-marathon?” “Well, my twenty-year high-school reunion is coming up next summer, and I want to look fabulous. But I’ve gained so much  ve years ago. I don’t know  how I can do it.” Bingo! Now we had a motivating goal. But I proceeded with caution. If you’ve ever tried to lose weight, you probably know  the drill: Buy an expensive gym membership, drop a fortune  on personal trainers, new equipment, spiffy new workout  clothes, and great athletic footwear. Work out vigorously  for a week or so and then turn your elliptical machine into  a clothes-drying rack, ditch the gym, and let your sneakers  mold in the corner. I wanted to try a better way with Beverly. I  knew that if I could get her to choose just one new habit, she’d get hooked, and all the other behaviors would naturally fall  into line. I asked Beverly to drive her car around the block and map out a one-mile loop from her house. Then, I told her to walk the loop  three times over a period of two weeks. Notice that I didn’t ask her  to start by running the mile. Instead, I started with something—a  small, easy task that required no major stretch. Then I had her  walk the loop three times in one week for an additional two  weeks. Each day she made the choice to continue on.     stop and continue walking. I asked her to do this until she could run one-fourth, then one-half, and then three-quarters of that  mile. It took three more weeks—nine outings—before she could  jog a full mile. After a total of seven weeks, she was jogging the  whole loop. That might seem like a long time for such a short victory, right? After all, half of a marathon is 13.1 miles. One mile  is nothing. What was something, however, was that Beverly was  t for the reunion—her  why-power (as I’ll soon explain)—was fueling her new health habits. The Compound Effect had been set in motion and was  starting its miraculous process. I then asked Beverly to increase her distance an eighth of a mile each outing (an almost unnoticeable length, maybe only 300 steps further). Within six months, she was running nine miles without any discomfort at all. In nine months, she was running  13.5 miles regularly (more than the distance of a half-marathon)  as part of her running routine. More exciting, though, was what  happened in other areas of her life. Beverly lost her cravings for  chocolate (a lifelong obsession) and heavy, fatty foods. Gone. The  increased energy she felt from the cardiovascular exercise and  better eating choices helped her bring more enthusiasm to her  work. Her sales performance doubled during the same period (which was great for me!). As we saw in the previous chapter, the ripple effects of all this momentum raised her self-esteem which made her more  affectionate toward her husband. Their relationship became  more passionate than it had been since college. Because she    more active and animated. She noticed she no longer had time to  hang out with her “Debbie Downer” friends, who still gathered  together after work for greasy appetizers and drinks. She made  new “healthy” friends in a running club she joined—which  led to a whole host of additional positive choices, behaviors, and habits.  rst conversation in my of ce and Beverly’s nd her why-power and commit to a series of small  steps, she lost more than forty pounds, becoming a walking  (and running) billboar t and empowered women. Today,  Beverly runs full marathons! Your life is the product of your moment-to-moment choices. In our SUCCESS CD (May 2010), TV’s Biggest Loser tness trainer Jillian Michaels shared with me a powerful childhood story:  “When I was a kid, my mom would have these elaborate Easter egg hunts for me. I would run around the house, and when I  would get close to a hidden egg, she’d say, ‘Oh you’re warm.’  You know, you get closer to it, ‘Oh, you’r re.’ And then you  move away from the egg and she’d go, ‘Oh, you’re cold, you’re  freezing.’ I teach contestants that, on a moment-to-moment basis,  I need them to think about their happiness and their ultimate goal as being warm—how every choice and every decision they make in the moment is getting them closer to that ultimate goal.” Since your outcomes are all a result of your moment-to- moment choices, you have incredible power to change your life  by changing those choices. Step by step, day by day, your choices  will shape your actions until they become habits, where practice  makes them permanent.    habits and instill the needed positive habits, and you can take your life in any direction you desire, to the heights of your  greatest imagination. Let me show you how…
